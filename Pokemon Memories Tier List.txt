						      Highlights
Description: Certain Pokemon are given "Highlights", which will be posted here. A Pokemon may be highlighted from any Tier, however, typically, they are chosen from the S-Tier. The Highlighted Pokemon's attributes are listed in the following order: Species, [Type], (Stats), Abilities, and [Viable Memory Discs].


							S-Tier

							Mewtwo
					              [ Psychic ]
			    	(Hp: 170/Atk: 335/Def: 185/SpA: 338/SpD: 185/Spe: 187) BST: 1400
					 Psychic Power/Hightened Mind/Antipathy
 			  [Dark Memory/Dubious Disc/Fairy Memory/Fighting Memory/Ghost Memory]
				[Ground Memory/Ice Memory/Poison Memory/Psychic Memory]


Description: Between its peerless offenses, blistering speed, and its perfectly distributed defenses; Mewtwo is an unparallaled force of mass destruction in this Meta. Whereas most Pokemon are biased toward specific sets, which serve as the primary cause for their exalted viability; Mewtwo is able to continuously adapt its sets on the fly, allowing it to always keep its opponents guessing. Its perfectly placed stats leave it with no major vulnerabilites, and its access to a nearly unlimited movepool, encompassing every Type in the game, makes it nigh uncounterable. Simply figuring out the opposing Mewtwo's set, is itself, a daunting task, and actually managing to successfully defeat it, is something that will usually only be possible after a very long struggle between both sides. Mewtwo's combination of attributes make it a force to be reckoned with, and when paired with its dangerous unpredictability, powerful teammates, signature items, and phenomenal abilities; This Genetic Masterpiece proves itself to be a powerful Pokemon that is second to none. We dreamed of creating the most powerful Pokemon, and we succeeded.



						     Calyrex-Shadow
						     [Psychic/Ghost]
			    	(Hp: 180/Atk: 270/Def: 160/SpA: 350/SpD: 260/Spe: 180) BST: 1400
					    Power Spot/Double-Layer/Antipathy
					       [Ghost Memory/Fairy Memory]


Description: In addition to having a dangerous Psychic/Ghost Type-Combination; Calyrex-Shadow also possesses an incredible Speed Stat, and one of the highest Special Attack stats in the game. Because of the incredible power it possesses, particularly through its devastating Astral Barrage, and Psycho Boost, Calyrex often doesn't even need to hold a damage-boosting Item to deal massive amounts of damage, and is easily capable of applying immense pressure on opposing Teams through its sheer presence alone. With its massive Speed Stat, Calyrex is capable of outspeeding almost every viable Pokemon in the game, and with a Choice Scarf in its possession, it is capable of even leaving foes like Mewtwo in the dust. In keeping with its Ghost-Typing, Calyrex has a few more tricks up its sleeves; With its Elemental Stones, Calyrex-Shadow can change the Type of its Hyper Beam, to potentially allow it to shred through foes such as Yveltal, Genesect, or Ho-Oh, while its limited, yet potent--Memorization skills, allow it to augment either its coverage, or power, to the point where even the sturdiest Teams can find themselves brought to kneel before this High King. Calyrex-Shadow may not excel in unpredictability, but across all of its sets, it is surprisingly versatile, and those who leave themselves vulnerable to its powerful offensive onslaughts, will find themselves left with a Team full of Ghost-Types.


							Arceus
					               [Normal]
			    	(Hp: 200/Atk: 300/Def: 210/SpA: 300/SpD: 210/Spe: 180) BST: 1400
						 Multitype/Impervious
					              [Up-Grade]


Description: While Mewtwo uses its 1400 BST to emphasize Offense; Arceus optimizes its Base Stat Distribution to ensure it can be as versatile and efficient as possible. Arceus' incredible Base 180 Speed, paired with its Base 300 offenses, allows it to outspeed, and imperil almost every relevant threat in the entire metagame, while its nearly limitless movepool, and access to Heaven Dance, ensures that no single Defensive countermeasure against this Pokemon is ever certain. While there are a number of Pokemon that also have comparable levels of power to Arceus, what truly elevates it above its peers, are its exceptional bulk, and access to the Ability, Impervious, which allows it to gain an Immunity to whatever Type Arceus is holding a Damage-Reducing Berry for. Because of these two factors; Even should the opponent find a way to overcome--or surpass Arceus' Speed, so as to dare try attacking it, there is no guarantee that such trifling assaults from the Mortals beneath it will even be effective, let alone fruitful. Between its immeasurable movepool, innumerable Multitypes, and its powerful Dubious Disc; Arceus is never a Pokemon that one should dare approach irreverently, lest they face Judgment.


							Dialga
						    [Steel/Dragon]
			        (Hp: 230/Atk: 280/Def: 210/SpA: 280/SpD: 180/Spe: 160) BST: 1340
					     Pressure/Telepathy/Regenerator
			  [Dark Memory/Dubious Disc/Fairy Memory/Fire Memory/Ice Memory/Rock Memory]


Description: Dialga's massive defensive stats, stratospheric offenses, and excellent Type-Combination already make it a force to be reckoned with, however what truly sets it apart from the rest of its peers is access to one of the best Abilities, and one of the best moves in the game--in Regenerator and Shell Smash respectively. Thanks to these two powerful resources, Dialga is capable of fulfilling a multitude of roles, from bulky tank, dedicated offense, hazard support, or even various hybrids of these sets--all while maintaining its Ability to perform excellently during games, and even potentially sweep through the opponent's Team. Dialga's ability to run nearly any kind of set--including frightening mixed sets, while synergizing with nearly every viable Item in the Tier--is unrivaled, and it is easily the most customizable Pokemon in the entire game. When building a Team, it is vital that players prepare an answer for this Master of Time, lest they find their ephemeral existence ground to dust.


							A-Tier

						      Meowscarada
						      [Grass/Dark]
			    	(Hp: 166/Atk: 270/Def: 150/SpA: 261/SpD: 170/Spe: 181) BST: 1198
						  Parlor Trick/Protean

Description: A Support Pokemon at heart: Meowscarada's incredible Speed allows it to perform its Tricks on almost any Pokemon. Thanks to its incredible Grass/Dark Type Combination, alongside its ability, Parlor Trick, Meowscarada is not only able to check opposing Calyrex-Shadow and Kyogre, but can even potentially tank a Fully Invested Adamant Sunsteel Strike from a +2 Atk Steel Memory Necrozma Dusk Mane. In addition to its Defensive Support capabilities; Meowscarada is also a fantastic Offensive Support Pokemon, being able to boost its speed with Trailblaze, or deal heavy damage to threats like Landorus-Therian, or opposing Meowscarada, through Slush Switch, respectively. Best of all, however, is its signature move, Flower Trick, which allows Meowscarada to change a Pokemon's Type, and lower both of their Defenses, while directly reducing the opponent's damage output for the Turn; A set of properties that Meowscarada is able to exploit, to weaken walls for itself or allies, endure otherwise fatal hits, or even cripple Pokemon that relied on Elemental Orbs as their primary source of power, such as Tapu Koko, or Entei. Meowscarada is one of the best disruptors in the game, and no matter what Team one goes up against, it will almost always find a way to support its Teammates. Foes should take care not to underestimate this Trickster, lest they soon discover that the Joke is on them.


						       Meloetta
						   [Normal/Psychic]
			    	(Hp: 170/Atk: 108/Def: 177/SpA: 288/SpD: 288/Spe: 170) BST: 1201
					    Serene Grace/Ensemble/Amplifier


Description: Ever the Songstress: This Musical Pokemon's love for its craft is evident through its ability to hit 50% harder with any Sound-Move as a result of its Special Mechanic. This, paired with its favorite Item, Throat Spray, allows this seemingly delicate Pokemon to become a rather ferocious threat once it sets up with Flutter Song or Flutter Dance. With its resonant Hyper Voice, Meloetta can melt even the coldest of hearts--and health bars, while those Pokemon with wills too powerful to be overcome by the Mythical Pokemon's magnificent Melodies--such as Mewtwo and Calyrex-Shadow, find themselves getting shouted out of the Audience--as well as the opponent's Party, through Screech. Meloetta's final move of choice places its artistic range on full display, as it gracefully switches to its nimble Pirouette Forme to deliver a devastating Storm Throw through the power of its Signature Ability: Ensemble. One may be tempted to stop and marvel at the offensive capabilities of this charming Pokemon, however the show does not end there. Ever intrepid: Meloetta's Normal-Typing allows it to remain completely unfazed by the vitriol of opposing Ghosts. Yes, even the noble King, Calyrex-Shadow, great as it is, finds itself powerless before the influence of this Musical Queen, and even its great Spectral Powers cannot quash the Song in its Heart. Meloetta does have one weakness, however: It has a tendency to be rather domineering, especially when it is on stage. If one wishes to share the stage with Meloetta, they best come before it as an ally, as any dissenters or opponents will be swept away.




						     Tier Assesments
S-Tier: Reserved for the absolute most powerful Pokemon; These Pokemon can fit on to every Team and immediately improve the group's viability through its presence alone, having the potential not only to fortify already powerful Teams, but elevate to viability Teams, Pokemon, and strategies that would otherwise be suboptimal without them. There are few, if any downsides to selecting a Pokemon from this Tier, and it is crucial that opponents have answers to these threats if their Team is to gain any traction in the Meta. 

A-Tier: Reserved for exemplary Pokemon that either fulfil a multitude of roles, or accomplish their specific roles with with peerless excellence. Pokemon in this Tier tend to have only minor weaknesses, all of which are almost completely compensated for by the immense utility provided for players' Teams. These are the Electrons that orbit the Nuclei of the Tier, and players should strongly consider having at least one of these Pokemon on their Team if they hope to gain any traction in the Meta.

B-Tier: Reserved for Pokemon that serve noticeable functions in the Meta, with varying degrees of success. Many of the Pokemon in this Tier have profound, or even rare strengths which cannot be found in the A-Tier proper, but possess glaring weaknesses that prevent them from gaining a spot in the aforementioned Tier themselves. Strategic play and additional support may be required to bring out these Pokemons' full potential, however when played optimally, they may be able to give Players the particular utility they'll need to gain traction in the Meta.

C-Tier: Reserved for Pokemon that are capable of fulfilling certain roles with a certain degree of success, but lack either the consistency or environment to fully capitalize on their positive attributes. These Pokemon are typically outclassed by the Pokemon in the Tiers above them due to either lacking a sufficient number of relevant strengths, or possessing too many exploitable weaknessness, however many of these Pokemon may be capable of rising to one of the higher Tiers, should either the meta change, or new sets end up being discovered within their current Meta. These Pokemon may require considerable skill to play, but might just provide the necessary resources to help players gain traction in the Meta.

D-Tier: Reserved for Pokemon that are almost completely outclassed by the Pokemon in the Tiers above them due to a number of intrinsic factors, which may never be completely remedied even with new set discoveries or drastic Meta changes. Pokemon often merit this Tier, due to either insufficient stats, poor typing(s), insufficient movepools, or being completely outclassed in the few roles they do have, by other, significantly more powerful Pokemon, among which, may even be variants of themselves. Researching these Pokemon may be helpful, should an opponent endeavor to use one of these Pokemon in a game, however well-designed Teams will likely have resources that can handle one, or even many of these Pokemon, regardless. As such, these Pokemon are not helpful for gaining any traction in the Meta.

Unranked: Reserved for Pokemon that were experimented with during development, but failed to meet the Meta's standard to justify placement in a proper Tier; Since this game is primarily balanced around Ubers, it could be entirely possible for these Pokemon to be viable in lower Tiers, however in this Tier, these Pokemon fail to accomplish anything of value, and should realistically never be used if Players hope to gain any traction in the Meta.

Conditional Placements: If a Pokemon that would otherwise reside in a lower Tier, finds itself worthy the A-Tier on account of its synergy with the Memorize Mechanic; Next to the Pokemon's name will be the letter of the Tier they would have otherwise resided in, alongside, if applicable, the particular Held Item, or Memory Mechanic(s) (e.g. Items, Abilities, etc) that contributed to their higher placement. (E.g.: PokePoke (D; Bug Memory)).

Note: Pokemon beneath the A-Tier, are listed alphabetically; Pokemon in the lower Tiers are assessed based on their Viability in their Standard Formes; Potential Memory Placements, will not be factored, unless they are sufficient to elevate them to the A-Tier.

						Memorization Ratings
Summary: Measures the benefit that a particular Pokemon derives from the Memorization Mechanic. Tiering is divided into three categories: Ratings, which are categorical, and observe the particular benefit Memorizing certain Pokemon has for the Team; Priority, which measures the order of consideration Players should give in assessing whether to Memorize a particular Pokemon, if a Player has it on their Team; And Dependence, which are individualized ratings, which represent the dependence of a Pokemon on the Mechanic, to justify their usage at all.

Ratings
Excellent - This Pokemon is an exceptional Memorization user, and is easily worth the Team's Memory Slot
Good - This Pokemon is a powerful Memorization user, and is a worthy user of the Team's Memory Slot
Average - Memorization modifies the Pokemon's Matchups, but doesn't significantly benefit them. Situationally useful.
No Benefit - Memorization either doesn't improve, or actively compromises the Pokemon. Generally not worth the slot.

Priority
0 - This Pokemon does not need to be Memorized
1 - This Pokemon is a Low-Priority for Memorization
2 - This Pokemon should be considered for Memorization
3 - Players should strongly consider Memorizing this Pokemon
4 - This Pokemon is a Top-Candidate for Memorization

Dependence
0 - Pokemon is mostly, if not entirely unreliant on Memorizing, and may even provide greater utility in its Base Forme.
1 - Pokemon may benefit from Memorizing, but possesses a similar level of viability even without its use.
2 - Pokemon's viability is positively affected by Memorizing, however it can still function on its own.
3 - Pokemon's viability is significantly impacted by Memorization, and will experience difficulties without it.
4 - Pokemon's usefulness is primarily, if not entirely dependent on Memorizing, and should not be used without it.

Key: P represents Priority, and D represents Dependence; The number in Paranthesis, is the sum of both P, and D.
Note: This is not a standard Viability Ranking; The following placements are indicative of their viability as Memory Users, not their overall viability, relative to other Pokemon; Pokemon within a Category are sorted Alphabetically

					    Kyogre-Check (Sponsors) Tier List
Summary: Measures how effectively certain Pokemon can handle Kyogre, while still providing valuable utility to the rest of the Team. Absolute checks may therefore be ranked lower than weaker checks, if they fail to provide significant utility to the Team beyond singularly checking Kyogre.

S-Class: Reserved for Pokemon that can not only consistently check Kyogre, but are capable of excelling in the Meta and substantially benefitting Teams even if Kyogre is absent. For these Pokemon, checking Kyogre is only one of many things that they can do, and they would still serve as indispensible members of players' Teams, even without a Kyogre to manage.

A-Class: Reserved for Pokemon that can most efficently check Kyogre whilst still providing utility to the player's Team; These Pokemon's viability is heightened by their matchup against Kyogre, but isn't contigent upon it.

B-Class: Pokemon in this class tend to do excellent jobs at checking Kyogre in a vacuum, but possess other significant weaknesses that create a significant opportunity cost when using them for this role. Pokemon can also end up in this Tier if they have otherwise favorable matchups against the rest of the Tier, but only check Kyogre under certain circumstances.

C-Class: Pokemon in this Tier can check, and even counter some of Kyogre's moves, but otherwise tend to have inconsistent or unreliable matchups against the rest of the Tier.

Category: A
Arceus
Hp: 200/Atk: 300/Def: 210/Spa: 300/Spd: 210/Spe: 180
Common Items
- Chople Berry
- Earth Plate
- Icicle Plate
- Leftovers
- Payapa Berry
- Pixie Plate
- Shell Bell
- Sweet Apple

Common Memories
- Dubious Disc (AG/Unlimited Exclusive)

Common Moves
- Agility
- Extreme Speed
- Fire Blast
- Glacial Strike
- Heaven Dance
- Infinite Velocity
- Judgment
- Recover
- Rock Wrecker
- Royal Retreat
- Volt Tackle

Preferred Abilities
- All

Playstyle: Arceus is best positioned in game as a Payapa-wielding Calyrex-Shadow sponge, or as a late game cleaner through the use of its signature E-Killer sets. It can also force opposing Mewtwo to engage in 50/50 mindgames depending on whether it is running a Payapa Berry or a Chople Berry. When attempting to run an E-Killer set, it is best to wait until Arceus' various answers are either sufficiently weakened or removed, as opposing Ghost-Types--or faster Pokemon that do not fear its Extreme Speed are capable of potentially frustrating Arceus' attempts to function. Bulkceus can also be run to allow it to sponge hits against a wider assortment of opponents, however Arceus' dubious STAB, paired with its lack of an offensive Ability, results in it being far more passive than its stats would suggest. If Normalceus is being used, Impervious should generally be run to grant it an additional immunity via the Super-Effective Berries; If Arceus is going to be Memorized, Multitype should be run to allow it to receive the minimum amount of Stealth Rock Damage

Arceus @ Chople Berry / Payapa Berry / Leftovers / Life Orb / Power Weight / Silk Scarf / Shell Bell / Sweet Apple
Ability: Impervious / Multitype 
Shiny: Yes  
EVs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe  
Jolly Nature  
- Extreme Speed  
- Earthquake  
- Rock Wrecker  
- Heaven Dance

Strengths
- Remarkable Speed Tier: Generally will have one of the highest Base Speed Stats in any given match
- One of the largest Movepools in the game
- Bulky enough to survive a number of powerful hits that would potentially overwhelm frailer Pokemon like Mewtwo
- Amazing versatility and power through its various Multitype Formes
- Powerful Dubious Disc sets that were oppressive enough to face litigation
- Extensive Support Movepool
- Can potentially destabilize Teams through the use of its E-Killer sets
- Situationally capable of checking Calyrex-Shadow, and frustrating opposing Mewtwo

Weaknesses
- Virtually useless STAB; One of the worse STABs in the game.
- As a result of the aforementioned weakness: Arceus is effectively less powerful than nominally "weaker" Pokemon with better STABs.
- Competes with Zacian-Crowned, and Mewtwo for the offensive role; It has more coverage than Zacian, and greater bulk compared to Mewtwo, however in being closer to an average between the two, it struggles to be as good as either
- Outsped by a number of problematic Pokemon, such as Meowscarada, Zoroark-Hisui, Zacian-Crowned, Tapu Koko, and Mewtwo
- Terrible Defensive Typing. Cannot utilize its Impervious to its fullest potential on account of it


Dubious Disc
Arceus @ Dubious Disc  
Ability: Multitype  
EVs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe  
Jolly Nature  
- Extreme Speed  
- Memory Blast  
- Rock Wrecker  
- Heaven Dance

Strengths
- One of the most powerful Pokemon in the entire game; Capable of OHKO'ing or 2HKO'ing most Pokemon, even without a Boost
- Unboosted Memory Blast hits harder than +2 Extreme Speed, effectively granting Arceus a perpetual +2 Boost at all times
- Notably, certain Pokemon that were completely immune to Arceus' STABs before, such as Caly-S, get obliterated by Heaven Dance Extreme Speed
- Virtually indestructable: Arceus' colossal bulk, paired with its complete lack of weaknesses, makes it nearly impossible to defeat in one--or even several hits
- Can realistically get away with running Monotype Coverage, due to the manifold versatility of Memory Blast + Extreme Speed
- Answers to one Dubious Disc set may be entirely useless against another; Pokemon capable of narrowly defeating offensive sets will get obliterated by Agility + Recover sets, while attempted answers to the defensive sets will crumble to "E-Killer" sets
- For all of the aforementioned reasons: Arceus-??? operates at a power level that is far too oppressive for Standard Ubers to handle, and as a result, has been restricted to Unlimited Ultra Assist, and Anything Goes

Weaknesses
- This Pokemon has no weaknesses

Earth Plate
Arceus-Ground @ Earth Plate  
Ability: Multitype  
Shiny: Yes  
EVs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe  
Timid Nature  
- Judgment  
- Venoshock / Glacial Strike
- Tailwind / Agility / Calm Mind / Recover
- Royal Retreat / Agility / Calm Mind / Recover

Strengths
- Powerful offensive Type that allows it to nail opposing Steels and Fires
- Capable of OHKO'ing opposing Pokemon such as Ho-Oh, on account of Judgment's Ability to hit Flying-Types
- Limited number of resistances to its STAB, and no Type-Immunities
- Immune to opposing Paralysis

Weaknesses
- Vulnerable to opposing Water-Type and Grass-Type Moves, which may become noticeable against Meowscarada, Palkia, Water-Attackers, and certain Mewtwo sets
- Difficult matchup against Kyurem-Black and Kyurem-White, due to its Ice Weakness
- Due to having several weaknesses to many of the best Types in the game: Its defensive abilities are deceptively limited

Icicle Plate
Arceus-Ice @ Icicle Plate  
Ability: Multitype  
EVs: 252 HP / 252 Spe  
Jolly Nature  
- Ice Hammer  
- Royal Turbulence / Earthquake / Flare Blitz / Fire Blast / Mud Sport 
- Stone Edge / Agility / Calm Mind / Recover 
- Recover / Agility / Calm Mind / Royal Retreat / Stealth Rock

Strengths
- Can tank hits from Palkia, Kyogre, and both Kyurems, while OHKO'ing them all with Ice Hammer
- Receives almost no damage from Stealth Rock due to Multitype, allowing it to more fully avail itself of its Typing

Weaknesses
- Shares Normalceus' Fighting-Type weakness, in addition to several more; Catnip for Mewtwo
- In addition, its Steel, and Rock weaknesses make it more vulnerable to opposing Dialga and Rock Wrecker Arceus
- Iceceus is particularly affected by its constraints, as it is completely powerless to use Impervious to mitigate any of its weaknesses

Pixie Plate
Arceus-Fairy @ Pixie Plate  
Ability: Multitype  
EVs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe  
Timid Nature  
- Judgment  
- Fire Blast / Mud Sport 
- Stone Edge / Recover / Calm Mind
- Recover / Agility

Strengths
- Incredible Bulk, atop a Type that ameliorates Arceus' Defensive inadequacies
- Fairy + Fire Coverage allows it to cover a substantial portion of the Tier
- Can survive at least one hit from nearly any threat in the Meta
- Can potentially clean up Teams in the late stages of the game via Agility/Calm Mind and Recover.

Weaknesses
- Slower than most other Arceus Formes, and as a result, is more susceptible to damage
- Struggles to defeat most healthy Steels before they can retaliate. Needs to be wary of Super-Effective hits, and Paralysis
- Cannot fully exploit its stats and typing on account of the constrained Item and Ability Slots

Dialga
Hp: 230/Atk: 280/Def: 210/SpA: 280/SpD: 180/Spe: 160
Common Items
- Chople Berry
- Dawn Stone
- Metal Coat
- Protector
- Shuca Berry
- Sweet Apple
- Weakness Policy

Common Memories
- Dubious Disc
- Fairy Memory
- Fire Memory
- Rock Memory

Common Moves
Constant = Shell Smash
- Aura Sphere
- Breaking Swipe
- Draco Meteor
- Dragon Pulse
- Fire Blast
- Flash Cannon
- Iron Head
- Stealth Rock
- Thunder Wave

Preferred Ability
- Regenerator

Playstyle: Dialga functions best when freshly switched into, via a slow pivot, or after one of its Teammates get K.O.'d. With 136 SpD, Dialga can comfortably endure Mewtwo's Adrenaline Orb boosted Aura Sphere, while also having enough bulk to survive a +2 Moonblast from Geomancy Xerneas from Full Hp. It is also recommended to invest 140 EVs into Dialga's Speed, in order to ensure that it can outspeed opposing +1 Calyrex-Shadow, and Mewtwo, after a Shell Smash. Unlike typical walls, which function through gradually wearing the opponent down over the course of several turns; Dialga is special in that it has the power to completely overhaul its playstyle, and reverse the momentum of the match through its powerful Shell Smash. Shell Smash is mandatory for ensuring that Dialga can carry its weight on Teams, however players should reserve its use for when they are certain that any opposing obstacles or checks have been neutralized, as Dialga will be unable to switch out until the move ends.

Dialga @ Sweet Apple  
Ability: Regenerator  
EVs: 192 HP / 176 SpD / 140 Spe  
Careful Nature  
- Breaking Swipe  
- Fire Blast  
- Flash Cannon  
- Shell Smash

Strengths
- Solid Bulk
- Massive Damage Output, once boosted
- Multiple chances to safely interact, due to Regenerator
- Dawn Stone +2 Draco Meteor is one of the strongest moves in the game; Dusk Stone Breaking Swipe can OHKO Ho-Oh
- Decent coverage
- Can viably run Mixed Sets
- Its Typing, combined with its bulk, allows it to check a number of the Meta's most problematic Pokemon.

Weaknesses
- Middling Speed-Tier, coupled with an exploitable Steel-Typing
- Insignificant Damage Output outside of Super-Effective hits, when unboosted
- Its Dragon moves have halved power under Hail, effectively cutting its power in half
- Cannot switch out for 3 turns after using Shell Smash; All boosts reset after 3 turns (Cannot escape with Shed Shell)
- Almost unwinnable matchup against Articuno-Galar, Suicune, and Urshifu-R (and to a lesser extent, Urshifu-S).


Dubious Disc
Dialga @ Dubious Disc  
Ability: Regenerator  
EVs: 116 HP / 252 Atk / 140 Spe  
Adamant Nature  
- Memory Blast 
- Iron Head  
- Thunder Wave  
- Shell Smash

Strengths
- Eliminates all of Dialga's Weaknesses, enabling it to take full advantage of its colossal Bulk
- Particularly, it significantly improves Dialga's Matchup against Lando-T, and Fighting-Types
- It's peerless Bulk not only allows Dialga to invest more offensively, but makes its Thunder Wave sets more consistent
- Due to the power of Oversight, Dialga can afford to exclusively run ???-Type Moves, without compromising its Power
- With both Memory Blast, and Facade: Dialga can hit opponents for more immediate Damage, with Memory Blast, while decimating Dragon Breath users, or Burn inflicters, with Facade
- Between its massive defenses, lack of weaknesses, and access to Regenerator: Dialga will not faint if it does not want to

Weaknesses
- Loses all of its Resistances, and immunities, making it vulnerable to Dragon Breath's Poison Status, while completely removing its Ability to defensively check certain Pokemon, such as opposing Water-Types.
- While Dialga's Typing means that it takes less Damage in extreme circumstances, it also causes Dialga to take more Damage, on average, causing it to rely more on switching in order to keep itself healthy
- Particularly noteworthy vulnerabilities, include Arceus' Extreme Speed, and Toxic Orb Sheer Force Bellsprout's Poison Sting, both of which can hit Dialga neutrally, for massive damage, especially after Dialga has used Shell Smash
- This causes Dubious Disc Dialga to function more as an OHKO-Safeguard, than as a direct defensive upgrade to Base Dialga 

Fairy Memory
Dialga @ Fairy Memory  
Ability: Regenerator  
EVs: 200 SpA / 168 SpD / 140 Spe  
Calm Nature  
- Memory Blast  
- Draco Meteor  
- Fire Blast  
- Shell Smash

Strengths
- Protects Dialga from opposing stat-dropping moves, and increases the power of its unboosted Moves
- Provides greater insulation against opposing Dragon-Type abusers
- Removes all drawbacks from Draco Meteor
- Enables it to challenge Pokemon that would otherwise give it trouble, Defensively, such as Cresselia, and Articuno-G
- Can survive any commonly run move from Mewtwo, at full health

Weaknesses
- Worsens Dialga's Matchup against various Pokemon, including opposing Dialga with Steel-Coverage
- Loses most of its utility as a Water sponge, due to losing its Dragon-Typing
- Increased vulnerability to Mewtwo's Stored Power, and Calyrex-Shadow's Psycho Boost

Fire Memory
Dialga @ Fire Memory  
Ability: Regenerator  
EVs: 116 HP / 252 SpA / 140 Spe  
Modest Nature 
- Fire Blast  
- Twister  
- Flash Cannon  
- Shell Smash

Strengths
- Prodigious Durability: Can freely switch in against Pokemon like Meowscarada, Ho-Oh, Tapu Koko, and the Kyurems
- Invalidates the standard options that Mewtwo normally runs (i.e. Psycho Fire, Aura Sphere, Inferno Beam) to check it
- Significantly increased Damage Output to the point where its +1 Fire Blast hits harder than the +2 Moves on most Normal Dialga sets
- Because of this, Dialga gains the coveted ability to threaten opponents even without setting up, increasing its offensive capabilities

Weaknesses
- Weaker Regenerator, due to the inability to use Sweet Apple concurrently with a Fire Memory
- Worsened Matchup against opposing Water-Types; Gets nailed by Mewtwo's Water Sport
- Does not expand Dialga's coverage options, and as such, is subject to being disrupted by any Fire-Resists that previous frustrated Dialga

Ice Memory
Dialga @ Ice Memory  
Ability: Regenerator  
EVs: 192 HP / 176 SpD / 140 Spe  
Careful Nature  
- Memory Blast  
- Iron Head  
- Aura Sphere / Fire Blast  
- Shell Smash

Strengths
- Almost completely invaldates opposing Scarf Palkia sets (however Fire Blast will still annoy it, somewhat)
- Memory Blast enables Dialga to consistently break through opposing Landorus, even after a Pacify/Inveigle drop
- Significantly improved Special Bulk, to the point where almost nothing can OHKO it on the Special side.
- The Ice-Type's massive coverage enables Dialga to use its otherwise riskier Steel coverage, allowing it to annihilate opposing Fairy-Types, such as Xerneas.
- Shares similar resistances to Base Dialga, such as Bug, Flying, Normal, and Water, while removing its Ground Weakness, making it a direct upgrade to Base Dialga, in certain Matchups 

Weaknesses
- While it shares many of Base Dialga's resistances, it also loses a number of resistances, such as Psychic, and Electric, worsening its Matchups against Pokemon like Zekrom, and certain Mewtwo sets
- Furthermore, its Steel resistance also becomes a weakness, making it vulnerable to priority Bullet Punch users, and in some situations, even opposing Dialga.
- Additionally, it loses its Poison immunity, reducing its effectiveness as a Dragon Breath sponge, while leaving it vulnerable to Bellsprout's Poison Sting
- Gains Rock-Type weakness, and by extension, a weakness to Stealth Rock, which can potentially limit its survivability

Rock Memory
Dialga @ Rock Memory  
Ability: Regenerator  
EVs: 116 HP / 252 Atk / 140 Spe  
Serious Nature  
- Memory Blast  
- Breaking Swipe  
- Fire Blast  
- Shell Smash

Strengths
- Turns Ho-Oh from a losing Matchup, into a winning one for Dialga, to where it can even serve as a switch-in for it.
- Provides coverage to bypass many of its common checks, similarly to the Fairy Memory
- Additionally, it allows Dialga to nail Ho-Oh, Rayquaza, and Entei, with a single move

Weaknesses
- Less relevant resistances than Fairy Memory. Particularly, its Matchup against opposing Dialga is potentially worsened
- Loses most of its utility as a Kyogre sponge, due to losing its Dragon-Typing
- Increased vulnerability to Mewtwo's Stored Power, and Calyrex-Shadow's Psycho Boost

Eternatus
Hp: 250/Atk: 272/Def: 205/Spa: 305/Spd: 205/Spe: 163
Common Items
- Black Sludge
- Earth Plate
- Fist Plate
- Prism Scale

Common Moves
- Autotomize
- Draco Meteor
- Dragon Breath
- Eternabeam
- Magma Storm
- Meteor Beam
- Recover
- Revelation Dance
- Shadow Ball
- Sludge Switch
- Stealth Rock
- Venoshock

Preferred Ability
- Space Power

Playstyle: Eternatus is best used as a "tank-and-run" Defensive Support Pokemon. Eternatus' prodigious bulk, and pivotal Resistances and Immunities allow it to handle several problematic Pokemon, and even deny opposing U-Turns, however its equally disastrous set of weaknesses prevent it from staying in for too long, without endangering itself. Thus, Eternatus should prioritize absorbing the hits that it needs to, and acting in anticipation of the opponent's next move, only attacking when certain that the opponent will either stay in, or switch to a wall, and Sludge Switching out, otherwise. It is not recommended to use Eternatus as a hard-wall, or Support Lead

Eternatus @ Black Sludge  
Ability: Space Power  
EVs: 252 HP / 4 SpA / 252 Spe  
Timid Nature  
- Venoshock
- Sludge Switch
- Dragon Breath
- Recover

Strengths
- Phenomenal, nigh-unrivaled 250/205/205 Bulk, which allows it to check some Pokemon through bulk alone
- Multiple notable resistances, including Electric, Fire, Grass, Poison, and Water
- These resistances allow it to check Pokemon like Entei, and counter Tapu Koko, Bellsprout, and Kyogre
- Extensive utility movepool; Can set Hazards, and clear them with a STAB Dragon Breath, with also intoxicates the opponent, allowing it to break down walls, while also potentially leaving the opponents vulnerable to Venoshock; Can also pivot out with Sludge Wave
- Slightly above average Base 163 Speed, which allows it to outspeed other support Pokemon, such as Ho-Oh, or Cresselia
- Amazing longevity, due to Black Sludge; Can potentially outpace the damage it sustains, allowing it to serve as a wall
- Immunity to Paralysis Damage, due to Space Power
- Decent offensive potential
- Space Power allows its Damaging-Moves to bypass opposing Abilities
- Can one-shot Kyogre with Venoshock, and can plow through most Waters with Venom Drench
- One of the best Prism Scale abusers in the game, due to Draco Meteor being a STAB move, and having the bulk to set up
- Has access to Autotomize, allowing it to outspeed the entire Metagame after a single turn of setup
- Decent Coverage; Meteor Beam hits Ho-Oh, while Shadow Ball can hit Pokemon such as Calyrex-Shadow, or Lunala
- Has access to Magma Storm, which allows it to potentially pick opposing Pokemon off, whilst hitting Steel-Types hard

Weaknesses
- Mewtwo; Eternatus' Poison-Typing makes it a prime target for Mewtwo, which is singlehandedly responsible for its dubious viability
- Poor Dialga Matchup; Compounds the aforementioned issue, as Eternatus can only hit Dialga Super-Effectively via a Fist Plate or Earth Plate Revelation Dance, forcing Eternatus to sacrifice both an item and a moveslot, only to fail to OHKO it in the end, regardless.
- The aforementioned Psychic-Type weakness also changes its matchup against Scarf Calyrex-Shadow--which would otherwise be manageable, into a 50/50.
- All four of its weaknesses are to relatively common Types (Dragon: Dialga, Ground: Landorus-T/Dialga Coverage, Ice: Aurora Beam/Slush Switch/Landorus-T coverage, and Psychic: Mewtwo and Calyrex-Shadow), making it deceptively vulnerable
- While Eternatus' noteworthy resistances allow it to safely switch in to certain threats, its equally notable weaknesses prevent Eternatus from actually sticking around.
- As a consequence of the aforementioned points: Despite its extensive support movepool, Eternatus is not a very effective Support Lead, or Dedicated Support Pokemon, and is instead forced to build its sets around switching into the Pokemon it knows it can check, and switching out as soon as possible.
- Eternatus' status as a Magnet for the most powerful Pokemon in the Tier, further hampers its usefulness, and can even make it a liability on certain Teams.
- Despite having access to Autotomize, Eternatus often struggles to find an opportunity to use it, due to the aforementioned factors
- Even with Autotomize, however: Neither Dynamax Cannon, nor Shadow Ball OHKO Mewtwo, and even with a Prism Scale boost, none of Eternatus' moves--including Eternabeam, can OHKO the common Dialga sets

Groudon
Hp: 160/Atk: 320/Def: 280/Spa: 240/Spd: 180/Spe: 160
Common Items
- Full Incense
- Gold Bottle Cap
- Light Ball
- White Herb
- Yache Berry

Common Memories
- Fire Memory
- Ground Memory

Common Moves
- Fire Punch
- Flame Wheel
- Precipice Blades
- Rock Polish
- Rock Slide
- Stone Edge
- Swords Dance
- Thermal Press
- Thunder Punch

Preferred Ability
- Drought

Playstyle: Since Groudon does not have the greatest defensive capabilities, it is best used during the middle of a game, after the Pokemon that preceded it either slow-pivots into it, or has fainted. It is highly advised to equip a Fire Memory on this Pokemon to mitigate some of its weaknesses and increase its sweeping prowess, however should this be unfeasible, one should instead equip it with a Gold Bottle Cap, or Full Incense. Drought will allow it to hit opposing Pokemon with its Fire-Type Moves, while Antipathy can be situationally run to punish opposing scarfers

Groudon @ Gold Bottle Cap  
Ability: Drought 
EVs: 116 HP / 252 Atk / 140 Spe  
Adamant Nature  
- Precipice Blades  
- Flame Wheel / Thermal Press / Fire Punch
- Stone Edge / Thunder Punch
- Rock Polish

Strengths
- Phenomenal Physical Bulk, being one of the highest in the game
- Decent Special Bulk, granting it above average bulk overall
- Amazing Offensive Typing
- Instant access to Full Incense and Gold Bottle Cap
- Powerful exploiter of Flame Wheel, especially when Memorized
- Immunity to Light Ball's Paralysis; Allowing it to use it for Thunder Punch
- Weather Support; Drought can enable Sun Teams, while frustrating other forms of Weather

Weaknesses
- Middling Speed Tier
- Highly exploitable Defensive Typing, often causing it to be a defensive liability for Teams
- Awkward Typing, given its ability; Does not synergize with the very Sun Teams it facilitates
- Poor Synergy with Teams, in general
- Massive Bulk is hindered by no relevant resistances
- Because of this, its bulk mainly just serves as a vehicle to help it set up, making it predictable
- Since Groudon is not a Fire-Type by default: Its Ability, Drought, can potentially enable the Fire-Type and Fire-Adjacent Moves of its opponents, which it will not be capable of effectively resisting.

Fire Memory
Groudon @ Fire Memory  
Ability: Drought  
EVs: 116 HP / 252 Atk / 140 Spe  
Adamant Nature  
- Precipice Blades  
- Stone Edge  
- Flame Wheel  
- Rock Polish

Strengths
- Allows Groudon to properly capitalize off of its Drought Ability, significantly increasing its power
- With a single Rock Polish, Groudon can potentially decimate Teams through the use of its Sheer Force boosted Flame Wheel
- Changes Ice Weakness, into a Resistance, improving its Matchup against opposing Ice-Type Moves and Pokemon
- Strengthens its auxillary moves, such as Thunder Punch, due to its Memory Ability

Weaknesses
- Does not fully ameliorate Groudon's Defensive vulnerabilities, leaving it vulnerable to many of the same threats it had before

Ground Memory
Groudon @ Ground Memory  
Ability: Drought  
EVs: 116 HP / 252 Atk / 140 Spe  
Adamant Nature  
- Precipice Blades  
- Flame Wheel  
- Swords Dance  
- Rock Polish

Strengths
- Removes the need for Groudon to run Stone Edge, as its Memory Ability allows it to nail Flying-Types, regardless
- Hits harder with Ground-Type moves, than a Full Incense set, and is more consistent than a Gold Bottle Cap set

Weaknesses
- Similar weaknesses as Base Groudon.

Rayquaza
Hp: 160/Atk: 320/Def: 185/Spa: 320/Spd: 185/Spe: 175
Common Items
- White Herb
- Life Orb
- Zoom Lens

Common Memories
- Fairy Memory
- Flying Memory

Common Moves
- Agility
- Dragon Ascent
- Dragon Dance
- Earthquake
- Memory Blast
- Stone Edge
- Tailwind
- V-Create

Preferred Ability
- Dragon Heart

Playstyle: Rayquaza's fantastic offenses may at first appear to signify its status as a Top-Tier Pokemon, however its dubious offensive Typing, paired with its inability to outspeed certain scarfers--such as Calyrex-Shadow after a Dragon Dance, makes its overall viability lower than what its stats and movepool would suggest in a vacuum. Tailwind can be used with a Zoom Lens or Flying Memory to significantly amplify its Damage Output, however the effects are only temporary, and may be further encumbered by opposing Utility Lock users. Memorization can help increase Rayquaza's power, however it then faces opposition from Pokemon such as Mewtwo, which naturally outspeeds it, while synergizing better with Memorization and Teams in general, due to its superior stats and Ability(s). Rayquaza operates best when positioned against opposing physically-inclined attackers, which it can attempt to set up for a potential sweep against, thanks to its ability, Dragon Heart.

Rayquaza @ Zoom Lens  
Ability: dragonheart  
Shiny: Yes  
EVs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe  
Adamant Nature  
- Dragon Ascent / Royal Turbulence
- Stone Edge  
- Earthquake / V-Create
- Tailwind

Strengths
- Powerful STABs
- Amazing Coverage
- Fantastic 320/320/175 Offenses
- Decent Base 160/185/185 Defenses
- Effective Base 390 Defense Stat when above 1/2 Max HP, due to Dragon Heart
- Due to the aforementioned bulk, Rayquaza is one of the most effective Tailwind setters in the game
- Amazing Zoom Lens abuser, due to its massive raw power
- Flying STAB gets boosted by Tailwind, allowing it to mostly compensate for the power sacrificed from eschewing Dance
- Potent Memorization Abuser: Fairy allows it to abuse V-Create with impunity, while Flying makes it into a bulldozer
- White Herb can also be run to allow Rayquaza to augment its Physical longevity
- With Air Lock, and a White Herb, Rayquaza can potentially serve as an emergency Scarf Kyogre/Phione check

Weaknesses
- Double Weakness to Ice, which is especially problematic as many Pokemon may naturally have Ice Moves to handle Lando-T
- Weakness to Stealth Rock
- Its Dragon-Typing makes it bird-feed for Tapu Koko's Nature's Madness, while its mediocre bulk causes it to get obliterated by Mewtwo's Stored Power
- Struggles to effectively OHKO Dialga without using potentially risky set-up moves or suboptimal natures
- Dragon Dance leaves it vulnerable to Scarfed threats such as Calyrex-S, while Tailwind has a notable comparative lack of power, outside of Flying-Type Moves
- Moderately-Sized Fish in a large pond; Base 175 Speed is objectively above average, but is noticeably outclassed by a significant number of its actual competitors; Its offenses are fantastic, however it needs a turn of setup to avoid being overwhelmed, while threats such as Mewtwo and Tapu Koko, do not.

Fairy Memory
Rayquaza @ Fairy Memory  
Ability: dragonheart  
EVs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe  
Adamant Nature  
- Memory Blast  
- Stone Edge  
- V-create  
- Agility

Strengths
- Memory Blast has a higher BP than a Super-Effective Earthquake, allowing Rayquaza to shred through foes, while hitting Dialga hard; Can sweep teams, under Tailwind.
- Immune to all stat drops, including from its own moves; Frustrates Lando-T, and allows it to abuse V-Create
- One of the few consistent checks to most Fighting Memory Mewtwo sets
- Changes the Dialga Matchup from a losing one, to a generally favorable one
- A set of Memory Blast/Stone Edge/V-Create/Tailwind allows Rayquaza to hit almost anyone hard enough to OHKO or 2HKO

Weaknesses
- Steel Weakness; becomes more vulnerable to opposing Steel Memory Necrozma-Dusk-Mane
- Poison Weakness; Subject to being picked off by Bellsprout, or OHKO'd by certain Eternatus sets

Flying Memory
Rayquaza @ Flying Memory  
Ability: dragonheart  
Shiny: Yes  
EVs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe  
Jolly Nature  
- Dragon Ascent  
- Stone Edge  
- Swords Dance  
- Tailwind / Agility

Strengths
- Dragon Ascent will not drop Rayquaza's stats when Memorized into a Flying-Type, allowing it to abuse its best Flying-Type Move without consequences
- Due to the synergistic Power Boost from a same-type Memorization, paired with Tailwind granting Flying-Memorized Pokemon a x1.5 Flying-Type Move boost, rather than the standard x1.3: Rayquaza's Flying-Type Moves are significantly more powerful under Tailwind, compared to its Zoom Lens sets
- Thanks to the combination of its x2 STAB Multiplier, and Ethereal Sky's tinted lens affect, Rayquaza can even cleave through several resists, especially when paired with Tailwind

Weaknesses
- Lower damage output on non-STAB moves compared to Zoom Lens, or Life Orb sets; Arguably worse matchup against Dialga
- Due to the similarities between this Memory Forme, and Base Rayquaza, there may be a notable opportunity cost incurred by using this Forme

- Ancient Power
- Blue Flare
- Clanging Scales
- Dragon Pulse
- Fire Spin
- Flame Switch
- Stone Edge
- Thunder

Preferred Ability
- Realist

Playstyle: Reshiram's fantastic Speed and Offensive Typing allows it to deal heavy damage to the Tier through its powerful STABs, especially when boosted by Realist. When it is at full power, it has the potential to easily 2HKO, or even OHKO a substantial portion of the meta, however its power will be noticeably impaired once it sustains any damage, so it is best used when switched in against vulnerable, but indispensible Pokemon on the opposing Team that will be forced to sacrifice a less important Pokemon to preserve themselves. While Realist protects Reshiram from opposing non-Damaging Moves; Unlike Zekrom, which still has a secondary function after sustaining damage, Reshiram will become effectively disabled (i.e. without an ability) if it falls below its Max Hp.

- Royal Rampage
- Slush Switch
- Strange Wave
- Stone Edge
- Volt Switch

Preferred Ability
Idealist

Playstyle: Ordinarily, Zekrom would be wholly irrelevant on account of being outclassed by Tapu Koko, who shares some of its weaknesses, while having significantly greater strengths, however the combined power of Idealist and Strange Wave allows Zekrom to carve out its own niche as a dedicated Choice Assassin that can attack opponents from either of their defenses without having to compromise its EV Spread to do so. Since the power of Strange Wave scales inversely with the Pokemon's Special Attack stat, Zekrom is able to freely invest its EVs into its Attack and Speed, while possessing a STAB Special Move that hits harder than most of its Physical Moves could. Furthermore, Zekrom's Special Attack stat is just low enough to allow it to hit the optimal number of 414 (236 BP) with the help of a SpA-Hindering Nature, and 5 IVs (411/239 BP achieves a similar result, but is technically suboptimal). In addition to its Choice-Locked sets, Zekrom also has the option to run Agility and Tailwind sets, which can potentially enable it to clean through weakened Teams, however its effectiveness will be noticeably impaired without the power from Idealist. If defeating Dialga is a particular concern, Royal Rampage can be substituted for another one of Zekrom's moveslots, however the sacrifice will be noticeable.

Zekrom @ Choice Scarf  
Ability: Idealist  
Shiny: Yes  
EVs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe  
Jolly Nature  
IVs: 5 SpA  
- Bolt Strike  
- Earthquake / Stone Edge / Flying Deluge 
- Strange Wave / Royal Rampage
- Slush Switch 

Strengths
- Decent Offensive Typing
- Bolt Strike deals massive damage, even when unboosted (provided it is holding a Light Ball)
- Powerful Mixed Coverage via Strange Wave
- Minus Nature 5 IV Strange Wave hits as hard as a 133 BP STAB-Move from a Neutral, 31 IV, 252 EV Physical Move
- Good Speed
- Incredible Physical Stats
- Teravolt allows Zekrom to bypass abilities, and force its way past potential checks under certain circumstances
- Has access to Pivoting moves
- Flying Deluge allows it to hit both Lando-T, and Ho-Oh for x4 damage, improving its Matchups against them
- Double-Layer, when paired with a Utility Umbrella, allows Zekrom to check most Kyogre sets, including its dangerous Sea Incense Thunder Wave sets

Weaknesses
- Limited means of breaking past bulky Grass-Types, Ground-Types, and Dialga; Struggles against Lando-T
- Predictable Sets
- Awkward Defensive Typing
- Inconsistent Offensive Typing
- Predictable and limited Movesets

Dark Memory
Zekrom @ Dark Memory  
Ability: Teravolt  
Shiny: Yes  
EVs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe  
Jolly Nature  
- Bolt Strike / Stone Edge / Earthquake 
- Memory Blast  
- Royal Rampage / Stone Edge / Earthquake 
- Agility / Dragon Dance / Royal Rampage

Strengths
- Ameliorates Zekrom's dubious Defensive Typing, notably allowing it to take boosted hits from Calyrex-Shadow
- Its three STABs hit nearly every Pokemon in the game, and can annihilate most of them, when boosted
- One of the most dangerous Set-Up Sweepers in the game; Can potentially sweep entire Teams, if they lack an answer
- Incredible Bulk, paired with its Memory Ability, allows it to tank many Super-Effective Priority Moves
- Oftentimes doesn't even need Dragon Dance to begin its sweep, due to Royal Rampage's speed boost

Weaknesses
- 4MSS: Without Ice Punch or Flying Deluge, Zekrom gets walled by Landorus; Without Royal Rampage, Dialga can beat it
- Increased vulnerability to Priority Moves, most notably, Low Sweep, and Bullet Seed
- Has difficulty dealing with faster Pokemon with coverage, if it cannot raise its Speed somehow
- Completely loses its ability to defensively check opposing Kyogre, due to being vulnerable to its STAB, and T-Wave

Electric Memory
Zekrom @ Electric Memory  
Ability: Teravolt  
Shiny: Yes  
EVs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe  
Jolly Nature  
- Bolt Strike  
- Earthquake / Stone Edge / Ice Punch
- Stone Edge / Earthquake
- Agility / Dragon Dance / Royal Rampage

Strengths
- Improves Zekrom's matchup against opposing Dragons, somewhat, while keeping its Thunder Wave immunity
- Comparable Power on Electric-Moves to its Light Ball sets
- Its Memory Ability, allows Zekrom to nearly completely reverse its poor Matchups against opposing Ground-Types

Weaknesses
- Worse Defensive-Typing; Completely loses its resistance to Kyogre, and gains nothing in return.
- Redundancy: Zekrom can accomplish similar feats of power with a Light Ball, without burning the Memory Slot
- Its Memory Ability, while powerful, is situational at best, as Zekrom's has a number of checks, not just Ground-Types
- Lacks the additional coverage imparted by the Dark Memory; Any non-Ground-Type 'Mon capable of handling Light Ball Zekrom, beats this.

Playstyle: While Mewtwo does not have a single "definitive" playstyle, there are certain things that Mewtwo generally doesn't do. Mewtwo usually does not want to run a Choice Item because there is no upgrade in the game that is worth sacrificing its Freedom for. It also does not generally want to run setup Status-moves outside of the rare Twisted Spoon sets, as opposing Scarfers will almost certainly be present to stop it. It is more than capable of running offensive Speed-Boosting moves, however. StallTwo can be run, be generally shouldn't be, as anything that can be stalled by StallTwo can simply be K.O.'d by Mewtwo. Psychic Power sets are best deployed during the early game, or following another ally fainting, as this allows Mewtwo to decimate its foes before its designated answers can switch in, while Hightened Mind sets are best used in the mid-to-late game, where Mewtwo can telekinetically wipe its hands of the remainder of the opponent's Team with impunity

Mewtwo @ Adrenaline Orb  
Ability: Psychic Power  
EVs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe  
Naive Nature
- [STAB Slot] Stored Power (Consistency) / Psystrike (Anti Set-Up) / Psychic Storm (Anti-Water) / Psycho Fire (Anti-Steel)
- [Steel/Dark Coverage] Aura Sphere (Most coverage, but Dialga can tank) / Inferno Beam (Nails Dialga, but not Dark-Types)
- [Bonus Slot] Water Sport (Power) / Mineral Cannon (Ho-Oh) / Aurora Beam (Lando-T) / Venoshock (Water/Fairy)
- [Mandatory Psychic Coverage] Night Daze (Consistency; Meloetta) / Comeuppance (Strongest) / Malice Run (Speed Boosts)

Mewtwo @ Dawn Stone  
Ability: Hightened Mind  
EVs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe  
Naive Nature  
- Stored Power / Expanding Force / Psystrike 
- Aura Sphere / Inferno Beam  
- Water Sport / Mineral Cannon
- Comeuppance / Night Daze

Strengths
- One of the highest Special Attack stats in the game
- Fastest non-Scarfed, commonly used Pokemon in the game; Becomes the fastest common Pokemon, with Hightened Mind.
- Notable outspeeds include: Arceus, Caly-S, Meowscarada, Tapu Koko, Zoroark-Hisui, and +1 Jolly Necrozma-Dusk-Mane.
- One of the largest learnsets in the game; Has a move for every Type
- General unpredictability, with two viable Abilities, and multiple viable sets, including a multitude of Memory Sets.
- Arguably the most versatile Memory Abuser in the game, with the largest number of known viable sets
- Extremely spammable STABs; Can sometimes run an entire set's worth of Psychic moves, viably.
- Particularly, Psychic Storm, and Psycho Fire, grant it a Super-Effective STAB on Water, and Steel, respectively.
- Decent Bulk, which grants it greater survivability compared to Pokemon with comparable levels of raw power
- Stored Power consistently hits harder than Dracolate Scarf Palkia's Boomburst, provided it has Psychic Power.
- A "charged" Expanding Force is also stronger than Palkia's Boomburst, with 240 BP, vs Dracolate Boomburst's 216.
- Incredible versatility, with arguably the greatest level of variability in the game

Weaknesses
- Mediocre, if passible, bulk
- Irrelevant Defensive Typing, which often leaves it vulnerable to Priority moves
- Particularly, a notable vulnerability to Shadow Sneak, which Caly-S, Mega Gallade, and especially Marshadow, exploit.
- Often dependent on coverage moves to reach full effectiveness, which is only partly compensated by Psychic Power.
- Difficult to use; Applying the wrong coverage moves can result in Mewtwo having "useless" moves during a match.
- Offers little defensive synergy, often leading to scenarios where Mewtwo becomes a wallflower in matches.
- Due to its incredible viability; Most Teams will have at least some specific, or, holistic means of facing Mewtwo
- This can in turn, result in Mewtwo's Speed being "invalidated" by Scarfers, or its power, neutralized by Walls
- Furthermore, due to threats, such as Meloetta/Caly-S, and opposing Mewtwo; An anti-Psychic coverage move is mandatory
- These restrictions result in Mewtwo's otherwise unlimited variability being underutilized in a practical environment


Dark Memory
Mewtwo @ Dark Memory  
Ability: Psychic Power  
EVs: 252 SpA / 252 Spe  
Timid Nature
- Stored Power / Psycho Fire 
- Aura Sphere / Inferno Beam / Venoshock / Mineral Cannon / Aurora Beam / Water Sport
- Memory Blast  
- Uproar

Strengths
- One of the few Memory Discs to make Mewtwo's Memory Blast stronger than Stored Power, with 234 BP vs 220 BP
- Allows Mewtwo to decimate formerly problematic Matchups, such as Cresselia, and Meloetta, with impunity
- Notably: Mewtwo can also pivot, or stay in, against Scarfed Calyrex-Shadow, under most circumstances, and win.
- Recovery gained from Mewtwo's Memory Ability, significantly improves its survivability
- Its Memory Ability also allows it to blast through even Special Walls, such as Calyrex-Ice, with ease
- The Super-Effective Damage Bonus from its Memory Ability, allows it to compensate for eschewing its Adrenaline Orb
- Gains viable access to one of the best moves in the game, in Uproar
- Fastest Uproar user in the game, allowing it to almost completely control the tempo of the match
- Gains notable resistance to opposing Dark-Type, and Ghost-Type moves, giving it a positive Matchup against Yveltal.

Weaknesses
- Increased susceptibility to Priority-Moves, as Low Sweep is both more common, and powerful, than Shadow Sneak
- Additionally, it gains a new weakness, in Grass-Type moves, and, by extension, Bullet Seed
- Worsened Matchup against Deoxys-Attack, who struggles to OHKO Base Mewtwo, but can easily one shot with Dynamic Punch
- No longer capable of out-brawling Xerneas, due to its Typing; Must either weaken it beforehand, or Uproar it out.


Dubious Disc
Mewtwo @ Dubious Disc  
Ability: Psychic Power  
Shiny: Yes  
EVs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe  
Timid Nature  
- Mystery Deluge  
- Psycho Fire  
- Mineral Cannon  
- Malice Run

Strengths
- Enables Mewtwo to viably run Flash sets, as Oversight converts it into a ???-Move, boosting its power, and enabling it to hit Ghosts.
- With the power of Flash, under Rain: Mewtwo is capable of one-shotting nearly every Dual-Typed Pokemon in the game
- Mewtwo's Flash is even powerful enough to take out certain Monotype Pokemon, however it is generally inconsistent
- Thanks to the Memory Mechanic's Power Bonus, and Mewtwo's Memory Ability, Oversight: Memory Blast hits harder than Stored Power
- When under any form of Weather, Mewtwo's ???-Moves become even stronger, allowing it to cleave through opponents
- Thanks to ???-Type moves having no resistances, or immunities: Mewtwo is able to brute force its way through its foes
- As Mewtwo has no Weaknesses, it becomes surprisingly difficult to revenge K.O.
- Notably, Mewtwo can potentially take a hit from any of Scarf Calyrex-Shadow's moves, provided Power Spot isn't active

Weaknesses
- ???-Type Mewtwo has no Weaknessess.... However, it also has no Resistances, nor does it hit anything Super-Effectively
- The only ???-Move that Mewtwo has, which hits Super-Effectively on anything, is Flash, which is what it usually runs
- This causes Dubious Disc Mewtwo, to arguably be the most gimmicky, and thus, inconsistent, Memory Set, of them all
- While the power boosts granted by Weather, and Oversight, are workable in conjuction with Mewtwo's massive offenses: It is almost always going to be a better investment, to either pick a Memory Disc with actual Type Matchups, or to Memorize an entirely different Pokemon, outright, and run an Adrenaline Orb


Fairy Memory
Mewtwo @ Fairy Memory  
Ability: Psychic Power  
EVs: 140 Atk / 116 SpA / 252 Spe  
Naive Nature  
- Psycho Fire  
- Memory Blast  
- Mineral Cannon  
- Psycho Rush

Strengths
- Due to the power of Fairy Aura: Mewtwo is able to effective hit harder with Memory Blast, than with a Super-Effective, Psychic Power-boosted Night Daze, allowing a 140 Atk/116 SpA/252 Spe invested Mewtwo to OHKO Calyrex-Shadow, opposing Mewtwo, and even Base Mewtwo's nemesis, Light Inversion Necrozma Dawn Wings--while having enough EVS left over in its SpA to easily tear through Steels with Psycho Fire.
- Provides complete protection from all stat drops, completely elimating Rock Tomb, and Parting Shot, as means of Speed Control, or Power Control, respectively.
- The overwhelming power of Mewtwo's Fairy Aura-boosted Memory Blast, allows Mewtwo to condense its coverage, being one of the only Mewtwo sets that doesn't necessarily require a Dark-Type move, to handle its troublesome matchups
- This allows Mewtwo--if it wishes, to potentially annihilate both Lando-T, and Ho-Oh, with Avalanche, and Mineral Cannon, respectively (Avalanche should be used over Mineral Cannon, as it bypasses Lando's Assault Vest)
- This set also synergizes well, offensively--with Speed Boosting Mewtwo variants, such as Psychic Wind sets, due to its aforementioned power

Weaknesses
- Most likely needs a way to deal with Steels, either directly, or indirectly; Opposing Dialga or Necrozma-Dusk-Mane, with Steel-Coverage, for instance, can delete Mewtwo, if it isn't careful, or prepared--against these threats
- Gets obliterated by Sheer Force Toxic Orb Bellsprout's Poison Sting, limiting its ability to run Speed Boosting sets, overall, despite offensively synergizing well with them.
- Becomes vulnerable to opposing Mewtwos' Stored Power, and Calyrex-Shadow's Psycho Boost, keeping its matchup similarly disadvantageous against a Scarfed Calyrex, while worsening its Matchup against opposing Mewtwo
- In addition to opposing Steel-Types, Mewtwo may also potentially need to have a countermeasure for Fire-Types--which also tank its Fairy Moves, as well, due to Entei being able to tank both Memory Blast, and Psycho Fire, while OHKO'ing with an Anger Point, Flame Orb-boosted Sacred Fire, in return.

Fighting Memory
Mewtwo @ Fighting Memory  
Ability: Psychic Power  
EVs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe  
Jolly Nature  
- Psycho Cut / Mineral Cannon / Iron Tail 
- Power-Up Punch  
- Trailblaze  
- Feint Attack

Strengths
- With a set of Power-Up Punch/[Speed Boosting Move]/Feint Attack; Mewtwo can annihilate most of the threats in the game; The Fourth Slot, is therefore, highly customizable. This set, however, is only one of many potentially viable ones
- Arguably the most distinctive, out of all of Mewtwo's sets, not only relative to its Memory Sets, but even its Standard Sets, due to the role it gains as a Physical Attacker
- Base Mewtwo's relatively lacklustre Physical Fighting Coverage, gets completely remedied by its access to both Memory Blast, and the Base Power Boosts that it gains thanks to Perfect Form
- Mewtwo's incredible Fighting-STAB, paired with its Memory Ability, Perfect Form, changes Power-Up Punch from being an irrelevant move, to one of the most dangerous moves in the game
- Power-Up Punch shreds through Pokemon like Dialga, Empoleon, and Steel Memory Necrozma Dusk Mane, OHKO'ing them
- Thanks to the combined strength of Psychic Power, and Perfect Form, Mewtwo can OHKO Cresselia with Feint Attack
- Trailblaze allows Mewtwo to increase its speed, to beat opposing Scarfers, while also hitting hard enough to OHKO threats, like Palkia
- Has a significantly stronger Low Sweep, allowing it to more easily pick off weakened threats
- Ameloriates most of Mewtwo's issues with Priority Moves, with the remaining threats being predictable, or irrelevant.

Weaknesses
- Terrible Defensive Typing, especially since opposing Mewtwo exist; Laundry-List of Weaknesses
- Becomes Revenge-K.O. Fodder for Bellsprout, being instantly annihilated by its Sheer Force T-Orb Poison Sting.
- Being a Physically-Oriented Attacker leaves it vulnerable to Burns, which can potentially cripple it--however this can be remedied through running a Rain Setter to prevent, or cure Burns for it.
- Due to the negligible benefits gained from running a Special Set; Mixed Sets are somewhat inferior, compared to Mewtwo's Adrenaline Orb Sets
- Because of the aforementioned point: Mewtwo may struggle somewhat, against physically bulky Pokemon, such as Entei, if it is lacking a Super-Effective Move (or Stored Power), or Ho-Oh, which Mewtwo may lack the space to run Mineral Cannon for (despite being Physical: Mewtwo generally runs it on Mixed Sets, as Stored Power--paired with its other Special Moves, generally compensate for Rock's limited coverage, which is inapplicable, for Physical Sets)
- Additionally, Mewtwo can struggle against certain Landorus-Therian sets, if it cannot hit it Super-Effectively
- Arguably needs at least one speed-boosting move, as otherwise, Scarfers, like Calyrex-Shadow, or Palkia, will continually force it out, while potentially stealing the momentum back from Mewtwo's Team, due to these factors.

Flying Memory
Mewtwo @ Flying Memory  
Ability: Psychic Power  
EVs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe  
Timid Nature  
- Hurricane  
- Psycho Fire  
- Water Sport  
- Night Daze

Strengths
- Allows Mewtwo to nail threats like Meowscarada, and Bellsprout, without having to sacrifice a coverage slot for them
- Not the easiest Type to account for; Allows Mewtwo to at least hit threats neutrally, most of the time
- Synergizes well with Psycho Fire, which allows it to decimate opposing Steels, which are the most common Flying resist
- When under the effects of Tailwind, Mewtwo's Hurricane becomes even stronger than Psychic Memory Mewtwo's unboosted Psychic Storm, and Psycho Fire, having an effective Base Power of 405, over their 403.
- The aforementioned points make Flying Memory Mewtwo an excellent Tailwind Sweeper, with almost nothing surviving it

Weaknesses
- Despite Flying being an elusive Type, it is resisted by a substantial number of Types, many of which it is weak to. Mewtwo can generally cover opposing Rock-Types with Water Sport, but generally wants to run Psycho Fire for Steels, in order to ensure it can OHKO opposing Dialga, Zacian-Crowned, and Steel Memory Necrozma-Dusk-Mane. This leaves Mewtwo vulnerable to opposing Ice-Types, however, and it is especially weak against Ice-Memorized Pokemon.
- Without Tailwind active, Mewtwo's effective power is significantly lower, having only an effective 270 BP off of Hurricane, which is weaker than Adrenaline Orb Mewtwo's effective 396 BP from Stored Power. Since Flying Memory Mewtwo cannot, itself, hold an Adrenaline Orb, this means that, Flying-Type moves notwithstanding, Flying Memory Mewtwo is universally inferior to both Adrenaline Orb Mewtwo, and even Hightened Mind Mewtwo sets; Without being part of a larger Tailwind set, Flying Memory Mewtwo is a wasted use of Memorization, both for Mewtwo, and the Team as a whole.

Ghost Memory
Mewtwo @ Ghost Memory  
Ability: Psychic Power  
EVs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe  
Timid Nature  
- Shadow Flame / Poltergeist  
- Aura Sphere / Energy Ball / Aurora Beam / Venoshock
- Mineral Cannon / Venoshock / Aura Sphere / Solar Beam 
- Frost Step / Malice Run / Aqua Step / Psychic Wind / Psycho Rush

Strengths
- Thanks to its Ghost-STAB, and the Memory Mechanic's power bonus: Poltergeist's power rivals that of Stored Power's.
- In addition to the incredible power it provides: Poltergeist significantly boosts the effectiveness of Mixed Sets.
- No longer has to worry about Normal-Types such as Meloetta, absorbing its Ghost Coverage, as it can now hit them
- Significantly improves Mewtwo's longevity, due to its Memory Ability's noteworthy healing properties
- Allows Mewtwo to serve as a potential switch-in, and answer, to non-Dubious Disc E-Killer Arceus sets
- Grants an immunity to Fighting-Type moves, and a resistance to Steel-Type moves, shielding Mewtwo completely from Fighting-Type Priority, whilst significantly weakening opposing Bullet Punches.
- Arguably the Type with the best Matchups against Priority, as most are either neutral hits, or absorbed, with Shadow Sneak being easily handled via Teammates, or even a healthy Mewtwo, under some circumstances.
- Altogether: These Type-Matchup changes, give Mewtwo a genuine defensive niche, in the Metagame

Weaknesses
- With the exception of certain Priority Moves: Mewtwo's general vulnerabilities, such as, to Scarfers, and Shadow Sneak--remain unchanged, leaving it susceptible to many of the same answers as Base Mewtwo
- Loses a noticeable amount of power--Ghost-Type moves, notwithstanding--due to forgoing Adrenaline Orb, which becomes apparent against certain Pokemon, such as Empoleon, and Bulky Dialga sets--if it isn't running Psycho Fire
- Because of these factors, while the Ghost Memory synergizes well with Mewtwo: It is fully capable of functioning, and fulfilling a nearly identical role, without it, thus, making this a potentially sub-optimal use of Memorization.

Ground Memory
Mewtwo @ Ground Memory  
Ability: Psychic Power  
EVs: 4 Atk / 252 SpA / 252 Spe  
Naive Nature  
- Stored Power  
- Memory Blast  
- Venoshock / Aura Sphere / Aurora Beam / Mineral Cannon  
- Poltergeist / Night Daze / Taunt / Malice Run

Strengths
- Enables Mewtwo to nail Ho-Oh, without having to run Mineral Cannon, which effectively only hits Ho-Oh
- Thanks to the power of Memory Blast, and Ground-Type STAB, Mewtwo can obliterate Ho-Oh, Eternatus, Empoleon, Necrozma-Dusk-Mane, Zekrom, Dialga, and Entei, with a single move slot.
- Loses its weakness to priority Ghost-Type moves
- Grants it the ability to situationally beat certain Zekrom sets, after it has set up, including Electric Memory Zekrom

Weaknesses
- Gains neutrality to Fighting-Type Priority, making it still somewhat vulnerable to threats like Marshadow
- While it loses its Weaknesses to Ghost-Type Priority, it is replaced by three new weaknesses to Grass, and Ice, and most concerningly--Water -Type Priority, which makes Urshifu Rapid Strike, and Keldeo, into potential checks
- Ground Memory's aforementioned Memory Blast coverage, can be be approximated by an Adrenaline Orb set of Stored Power, Aura Sphere, Mineral Cannon, and a Dark-Type Move, as this set will hit, and OHKO all of the aforementioned Pokemon, with the exception of Empoleon, Necrozma-Dusk-Mane, and significantly invested Dialga sets. Meanwhile, another Pokemon could be given the Ground Memory, as they likely need it more.
- This problem becomes exacerbated by the high demand placed upon Mewtwo, to handle the other top attackers in the tier, such as Calyrex-Shadow; Mewtwo will want to run Dark Coverage to support its Team, however this creates significant overlap with Base Mewtwo's Adrenaline Orb sets
- Mewtwo must also be extra wary of opposing Calyrex-Ice, which can tank most of Mewtwo's attacks, and OHKO in return. This only reinforces the need to run an additional Dark-Type move, however, with a set of Stored Power, Memory Blast, and Night Daze, this only leaves one free slot left. Mewtwo gains one free move slot, in exchange for using the Team's only Memory Slot.

Ice Memory
Mewtwo @ Ice Memory  
Ability: Psychic Power  
EVs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe  
Timid Nature  
- Psycho Fire  
- Memory Blast  
- Venoshock / Recover 
- Night Daze

Strengths
- Enables Mewtwo to serve as a potential Kyogre and Palkia check, potentially denying Teams their only Mewtwo answer
- Bulkier Special Defense, in general, allowing it to even take hits and respond, against mons like Scarfed Caly-S
- Allows Mewtwo to blast through even the bulkiest Inveigle Landorus-T sets, due to its overwhelming power
- Annihilates Ground-Types, and Dragon-Types, in general, due to Memory Blast being its best Ice Move
- Gains a number of useful resistances, including Flying, Ice, Water, and Normal
- This allows Mewtwo to potentially answer opposing Dragon Dance Rayquaza, and enables it to revenge kill E-Killer Arceus.
- Due to its amazing Defensive Utility: Mewtwo can viably run Recover on this set, to significantly increase its longevity
- Whereas most natural Ice-Types, are either slow, or frail: Mewtwo's solid stat distribution, combined with its limitless coverage, makes it one of the best Ice-Types in the game.

Weaknesses
- Steepest drop in Power: Ice Coverage is debatably necessary to justify the slot, however this demand, paired with the lack of Adrenaline Orb's Power Boost, potentially forces Mewtwo to drastically revamp its moveset, to function optimally
- Psychic Storm is needed to ensure Mewtwo can properly check Kyogre, Palkia, and other Water-Types, however, the relatively average Base Power of this move, paired the absence of an Adrenaline Orb to boost its power, significantly limits Mewtwo's damage output, overall. This is partially compensated for, through Memory Blast, but only partially.
- In addition to the aforementioned points: Mewtwo will likely need Recover to manage these threats, and offset its lack of immediate power, which would restrict its free coverage, to one move
- Due to this, Mewtwo particularly struggles against Steel-Types; Neither Aura Sphere, nor Psycho Fire, OHKO Empoleon, while Empoleon can OHKO in return, and neither moves do anything to Necrozma-Dusk-Mane; Running coverage for potential Necrozma, in turn, leaves Mewtwo countered by Empoleon, and even if it ran moves for both, Calyrex-Ice would still wall it. The same problem applies, if Mewtwo runs Mineral Cannon, or Poltergeist/Night Daze, for Calyrex-Ice.
- Lastly, similarly to the Dark Memory: Mewtwo gains a weakness to Fighting Priority, which, in turn, opens the door for dangerous Pokemon with dubious Matchups against Base Mewtwo, such as Marshadow, and Gallade, to become confident Revenge-Killers.
- All of these factors result in Ice Memory Mewtwo having a greater dependence on the overall Team's collective strength, rather than its own indiviudal power, to bring out its full capabilities

Poison Memory
Mewtwo @ Poison Memory  
Ability: Psychic Power  
EVs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe  
Timid Nature  
- Stored Power / Psycho Fire
- Venoshock / Memory Blast 
- Inferno Beam / Aura Sphere / Mineral Cannon
- Dark Pulse / Malice Run / Recover

Strengths
- Due to its Memory Ability's effect, of raising both stats by 1 stage, upon switching in: Mewtwo is significantly bulkier.
- Imparts a number of useful resistances, including Electric, Fairy, and Fire
- Together, this makes Mewtwo into a decent Zekrom, Xerneas, and Entei contingency check
- As Mewtwo is no longer burdened by its middling Defenses, it can afford to run moves, such as Recover, and can even experiment with set-up, or Team Support moves
- Outside of Psycho Darts, which few Pokemon run: Mewtwo is completely freed of its Priority Weaknesses

Weaknesses
- Due to Poison being a somewhat irrelevant Offensive Type (save for a few exceptions): Mewtwo will often have nothing to use its newfound Poison-STAB on.
- This usually means that the best sets for Poison Memory Mewtwo, are similar to those of Adrenaline Orb Mewtwo, with the possible exception of Recover. While Poison Memory Mewtwo's bulk helps it justify the Memory Slot, bulkier Pokemon, with Memory Armor, would likely appreciate it more
- Poetically, for all of the useful resistances Mewtwo has gained: It is now weak to Psychic-Type moves, placing it at an even greater disadvantage against opposing Mewtwo, and Scarfed Calyrex-Shadow, neither of which care about Mewtwo's stat boosts, while forcing Mewtwo to either use a slot to run coverage for them, or eschew coverage, in favor of repeatedly switching out, once they enter the field, sacrificing your momentum.

Psychic Memory
Mewtwo @ Psychic Memory  
Ability: Psychic Power  
EVs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe  
Timid Nature  
- Psycho Fire / Psychic Storm / Psystrike
- Aura Sphere / Inferno Beam
- Psycho Darts / Mineral Cannon
- Nasty Plot / Psychic Wind

Strengths
- Boosts the power of Mewtwo's Offensive Utility moves, such as Psychic Storm, and Psychic Wind, to the point where they are comparable in Base Power to an itemless Mewtwo's Stored Power
- With a combination of Nasty Plot and Psycho Darts, Mewtwo can run a "Psycho-Killer" set that can potentially sweep the opposing Team
- The boost to Psychic Wind, in particular, allows Mewtwo to use it on a weakened opponent, to faint it, and potentially initiate a sweep 
- This improves Mewtwo's utility, somewhat, as it allows it to compress its coverage, without having to run moves that would ordinarily fall below the Meta's Power-Standard.
- Boosts the power of Mewtwo's Priority Move, Psycho Darts, as well as its strongest Physical Psychic-Type Move, Psycho Blitz, on account of the STAB-stacking Bonus, that same-Type Memory Discs impart
- Mewtwo's Comeuppance also receives a noticeable power increase, allowing it to easily dispense of threats like Lunala, and Necrozma-Dawn-Wings, provided they are not Memorized into a non-Psychic Type.

Weaknesses
- While Psychic Wind sets can be devastating when executed properly, without these particular sets, the Disc uses much of its effectiveness
- This is the only Memory Disc with an actual penalty, particularly to Mewtwo's Burst Moves, meaning that, unlike with many other Pokemon, Mewtwo cannot simply use its same-Type Memory Disc as a direct upgrade for its vanilla sets.

Water Memory
Mewtwo @ Water Memory  
Ability: Psychic Power  
EVs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe / (Physical: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe)
Timid Nature / (Physical: Jolly / Naive)
- Stored Power / Psycho Fire 
- Water Sport / Memory Blast / Wave Crash
- Inferno Beam / Aura Sphere / Aqua Leap
- Frost Step / Malice Run / Night Daze / Aqua Rise

Strengths
- Aqua-Killer: With the combined power of Aqua Leap, and Aqua Rise, Mewtwo can increase its damage output to near unmanageable levels, enabling it to OHKO Cresselia with a 252 Atk Wave Crash, deal massive damage to its resists, and even OHKO opposing uninvested Calyrex-Shadow with Aqua Jet, after Stealth Rock Damage
- Significantly increases the power of Mewtwo's Water-Type moves, to the point where Hydro Pump can be used as a possible substitute for Stored Power, and can one-shot Ho-Oh, and Entei.
- Grants Mewtwo a spammable STAB, and improves its Matchup against certain threats, like Landorus-T
- Compliments Mewtwo's Stored Power, granting Mewtwo the ability to "dual-wield", and hit opponents with, effectively, two distinct Stored Powers, that each have entirely separate Type-Matchups
- Additionally, Mewtwo also receives a Power Bonus to its Ethereal Stream, which allows it to nail both Dialga, and Ho-Oh, without having to run Psycho Fire or Aura Sphere, and Mineral Cannon, respectively. It also hits Specially Defensive Assault Vest Lando-T hard, and OHKOs Entei, and every Zygarde Forme.
- Synergizes well with Rain Teams, on account of its Typing, and access to powerful Rain-Boosted Moves, such as its Water-Type Moves, Psychic Storm, and Flash.
- Fares notably better against standard Water-Type Checks, such as Suicune, Empoleon, Eternatus, and Calyrex-Ice, due to its massive selection of coverage moves, including Psychic Storm, Venoshock, Psycho Fire, Night Daze, and Mineral Cannon
- Loses its weakness to Ghost-Type Priority.

Weaknesses
- Swaps Fighting, and Ghost Priority weaknesses, for Grass, and Poison ones, the latter of which can be significantly boosted in power, via a Toxic Orb
- Is similar enough to Mewtwo, outside of its Aqua-Killer set, that it be suboptimal to run this Memory, without it. Using it, however, makes Mewtwo more predictable, and easier for opponents to deal with.
- Difficulty in finding a definitive niche, as the Meta generally already prepares for Water-Type moves, in consideration of Kyogre, who is arguably a significantly better Water-Type Pokemon
- Water Memory Mewtwo does not reliably check Kyogre, as it lacks the additional Special Defense boost, that its counterpart, Ice Memory, has, and additionally is weak to Electric-Type moves, allowing Sea Incense Kyogre to potentially beat it down
- Mewtwo gains a number of weaknesses, such as to Grass, Electric, Poison, and Lustrous Stream, while gaining nothing that it couldn't already do, in return.



						Mewtwo Microanalysis

Adrenaline Orb
Mechanics: Boosts the power of Mewtwo's moves
Usage Tips: Best for All-Out Attacking sets, as it is a strictly offensive Item; Likely Mewtwo's best offensive Item
Pros: Grants a Power Boost comparable to that of a Life Orb, without the Recoil
Cons: Doesn't provide Mewtwo with a means of raises its Speed, often forcing it to rely on Psychic Wind, to do so; Provides no direct Defensive Utility.

Berserk Gene
Mechanics: Mewtwo is perpetually burned, however its Atk is Raised by 2 stages upon switching in.
Usage Tips: Rain cures all burns, and prevents burns from happening; Mewtwo's Rain-Boosted Water-Moves are capable of dispatching most of the threats that would ordinarily require Dark-Type Moves, such as opposing Mewtwo, Calyrex-Shadow, and Meloetta.
Pros: Extremely high reward if used properly; Enables Mewtwo to use its more obscure Physical Moves, without having to Memorize
Cons: Requires significant Team Support and setup to execute properly; Without it, Mewtwo becomes effectively itemless

Dawn Stone
Mechanics: Pokemon's first successful Special-Move has x1.5 Power; Single Use..
Usage Tips: Best paired with Hightened Mind; Abstain from using Mewtwo until Teams are sufficiently weakened, then unleash its full power (ideally on a wall) when the time is right.
Pros: With Dawn Stone's Boost: Aura Sphere, and Water Sport, can potentially OHKO Dialga, and Ho-Oh, respectively. Excellent means of manually triggering Mewtwo's Hightened Mind ability.
Cons: Only good for a Single Use, and can thus be exploited, if the opponent predicts it.

Energy Powder
Mechanics: Raises Pokemon's Speed by 1 stage upon successfully landing a Super-Effective Move
Usage Tips: Best used in the Mid to Late Game phase to ensure Mewtwo's Sweep goes unimpeded; Utility will ultimately prove more important than raw power, as Mewtwo will struggle to OHKO foes, such as Bulky Dialga, due to lacking its Adrenaline Orb. Thus, Psycho Fire may be a superior investment, over moves such as Stored Power, and Aura Sphere, as it condenses their roles. A Dark-Type move should also be run, to handle opposing Mewtwo, Meloetta, Cresselia, and Calyrexs. The other slots, however, are customizable.
Pros: Enables Mewtwo to potentially increase its Speed, without relying on weak Moves, such as Psychic Wind
Cons: Sacrifices the power of Adrenaline Orb, and only activates once. If Mewtwo fails to sweep, and is forced to switch out, it will be left Itemless

Odd Incense
Mechanics: Doubles the Base-Power of Psychic-Type moves, if the Pokemon is at or below 1/4 Max HP
Usage: Run Psystrike/Stored Power, Psycho Fire/Aura Sphere/Electro Ball/Dark Pulse, Psycho Darts, and Nasty Plot.
Pros: Easily the set with the highest overall Damage Output; Allows it to beat opposing priority with its own; Doesn't depend on coverage as a primary means to deal game-deciding Damage; Can potentially sweep Teams.

Cons: Requires extensive knowledge on the Metagame, so as to know what will proc, and what will just be unnecessary Damage, that potentially causes other moves that would have procced, to simply K.O. Mewtwo, instead; Most limited coverage out of all of Mewtwo's sets; Mewtwo needs Psycho Darts to justify this set's use over another, more consistent one, yet it also needs Psystrike, to improve its Matchup against Meloetta, Cresselia, and both Calyrexs, (Stored Power can potentially one shot the first three, but will fail to OHKO Calyrex-Ice). This leaves one final slot to handle the rest of Odd Incense Mewtwo's Bad MUs, such as Yveltal, Empoleon, a healthy Caly-Ice, and most concerning of all, Necrozma-Dusk-Mane, which tanks both Psystrike and Psycho Darts, and generally gives this set a hard time.

Sweet Apple
Mechanics: Heals Pokemon by a certain amount, upon switching out
Usage Tips: Allows Mewtwo to fearlessly brawl with Pokemon that otherwise might not always be OHKO'd by Mewtwo, but cannot OHKO it, in return, such as Cresselia, Ho-Oh, or Corviknight; Keeps Mewtwo healthy, which is relevant in certain Matchups, such as Timid Scarf Palkia, which threatens Mewtwo, but does not usually OHKO it, outright.
Pros: Significantly improves Mewtwo's longevity; Enables Mewtwo to play more aggressively, and wear down bad Matchups
Cons: Sacrifices the Power Boost of Adrenaline Orb, which in turn may force it into using redundant, or otherwise riskier moves to achieve the desired damage output.

Twisted Spoon
Mechanics: Raises Mewtwo's Spe by 1 stage, upon using a Status-Move; Resets all stats after 3 turns. Single Use.
Usage Tips: Hits through Protect, for 1/2 Damage; Best used with Nasty Plot; Good for crippling opposing Teams in the Mid to Late game stage; Keeps Twisted Spoon's Native x1.2 Psychic-Move boost
Pros: Enables Mewtwo to overcome Scarfers, whilst allowing it to use Nasty Plot, without sacrificing its momentum
Cons: Significantly narrower intrinsic Power Boost, compared to Adrenaline Orb; Immediately renders Mewtwo Itemless, upon successfully activating this Item's effects; Potentially vulnerable to being timed out



						    Quick Sets

Summary: The definitive compendium for various Pokemon, Strategies, or Sets that do not have enough depth or merit to warrant a proper Setpedia Analysis, but are still effective in their own capacity.

Eternatus (Prism Scale Sweeper)

Eternatus @ Prism Scale  
Ability: spacepower  
EVs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe  
Modest Nature  
IVs: 0 Atk  
- Draco Meteor  
- Eternabeam  
- Magma Storm  
- Autotomize

Description: Draco Meteor, being a Heavy-Move (lowers a Pokemon's attacking stat by at least 2 stages), triggers Prism Scale, which raises the user's SpA by 3 stages upon using one of these moves, which allows Eternatus to set up with Autotomize (now raises Pokemon's speed by 4 stages) to outspeed the entire Tier, then proceed to unleash Draco Meteor on an opponent, to set up for a potential Eternabeam sweep. Magma Storm is a contingency move, to ensure that Eternatus can hit stray Steels that may be capable of resisting its other moves.


Electric Calyrex-Ice
Calyrex-Ice @ Electric Memory  
Ability: Ice Scales  
EVs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe  
Jolly Nature  
- Glacial Lance  
- Memory Blast  
- Swords Dance  
- accelerate

Description: Calyrex-Ice's incredible natural 180/260/200 bulk, paired with its ability, Ice Scales, allows Calyrex-Ice to endure hits from even the Meta's strongest, while still having enough HP to retaliate, and stay on the field. Unfortunately, Calyrex-Ice was held back by its Psychic/Ice Typing, which among other things, left it vulnerable to powerful moves like Mewtwo's Comeuppance, Mineral Cannon, or Night Daze, Ho-Oh's and Entei's Sacred Fire, or Arceus' Rock Wrecker. Fortunately, the Electric Memory not only amelioriates these issues, but provides it with an offensive typing that has been gaining a notable amount of traction against opposing Tailwind Teams: The Electric Type. Thanks to its Base 350 Attack, Calyrex-Ice is able to OHKO anything from Vaporeon, to Yveltal, and even Skarmory, with its powerful Memory Blast, while still maintaining enough power compared to its Snowball sets, to keep its Glacial Lance OHKOs against the Pokemon it hits Super-Effectively, such as Eternatus, Yveltal, or Landorus-Therian. Electric Calyrex-Ice works best under Tailwind, so Skarmory and Yveltal tend to pair well with it. Whenever possible, use Glacial Lance to secure K.O.'s if Calyrex-Ice's Attack does not have at least one positive stage boost, as Glacial Lance will raise its Attack by 1 stage, if it doesn't already have at least +1 in its Attack.

=====================================================================================================================
						      Section B    
						     Ultra Assist
Description: "Ultra Assist" is one of the new Mechanics introduced in Pokemon Memories that allows a Pokemon with an Assist Drive to become the "Anchor" for their Team, Fainting upon switching in to provide various benefits to their Teammates. In keeping with the concept that all Pokemon are unique and special in their own way; The effects of each Ultra Assist depends on the Anchor's Species, Stats, and Typing, with the highest raw stat ("Dominant"/"Primary") Stat receiving the highest boost, while ("Recessive"/"Secondary") Stats receive a smaller one. Additionally, any opposing Moves corresponding to the Anchor's own Type(s) will deal reduced damage to the Anchor's Team, allowing for players to insulate themselves from otherwise problematic opponents. Finally, certain Pokemon--known as EX Pokemon--sacrifice the ability to grant stat boosts in exchange for the power to grant the Team unique properties with varying effects.

The unique properties of this Format--paired with the prohibition of using Memorization in it--causes the Matchups and Viability Rankings to be drastically different compared to the Standard Meta, with many Pokemon that may be considered subpar in the original Meta to be prodigiously powerful in the Ultra Assist Format, while staples that defined the aforementioned Meta find their powers limited here


						     Tier Assesments
S-Tier: Reserved for the Anchors most capable of setting optimal Assist States, and the Allies that are most capable of abusing them. Anchors in this Tier tend to possess powerful Type-Combinations that allow them to insulate their Team from opposing threats, while wielding stat spreads that allow them to impart potentially ambiguous Stat Boosts to the rest of their Team. Allies, on their part, can remain viable across a number of different Assist States, resist the power of the opponent's own Assist States, or exploit particular Assist States to an extent that allows them to redefine the dynamics of the environment around them.

A-Tier: Anchors in this Tier tend to be capable of setting powerful Assist States that can potentially insulate their Team from otherwise dangerous threats. Allies either tend to benefit appreciably from one or more Assist States, or are capable of maintaining a measure of their "Standard" Format power in spite of them, however, unlike S-Tier Pokemon, Allies in this Tier usually do not benefit from the Assist Meta to the same extent that they do.

B-Tier: Anchors in this Tier either tend to grant Assist States that are viable, yet inferior to the Anchors above them, or are too valuable to serve as Anchors, despite not necessarily serving as Top-Tier beneficiaries. Pokemon may either be Allies with more situational capabilities, or Pokemon that provide insufficient benefits to consistently merit a Team-Slot over a more powerful Teammate. Despite this, these Pokemon may still offer key benefits to the Team, and can be useful under the proper circumstances

Tiering: Due to the substantial mechanical differences between Normal Pokemon and Anchors: The Tier List/Viability Ranking is divided into two Tiers: The "Standard" (i.e. Normal Pokemon/Allies) Tier, and a separate "Assist" Tier that is specifically designed for measuring a Pokemon's capabilities as an Anchor.

Note: If applicable, Pokemon will have a set of recommended Stat Boosts and Type Shields listed in brackets. For instance: (Poke [Boosts: Atk, SpA // Types: Fighting, Flying, ??? // Priority: 5]) would mean that "Poke" ideally wants to be under an Assist State that boosts either its Attack or Special Attack, and would benefit most if the Team's Anchor had any combination of the Fighting, Flying, and ??? -Types, while a Priority of 5 indicates that the Anchor should prioritize granting Type Shields for it over Pokemon with a lower Priority.

Priority Values
1: Pokemon may benefit from a Type Shield, but can operate without one
2: Pokemon may benefit from a Type Shield, and will be noticeably more effective with one
3: Pokemon may begin to experience difficulties without certain Type Shields
4: Pokemon should be Prioritized for a Type Shield, either because the protection imparted will significantly benefit the Team as a whole, or because they need it to function properly

						 Pokemon Spotlight
						      Mewtwo
Description: Due to the volatility of the Tier, paired with the loss of Memorization, and the potential for opposing Assist States to disrupt Mewtwo's Machinations, it is not nearly as oppressive as it is in Standard Ubers, however, in no longer being the undisputed best, Mewtwo has gained the potential to tap into its recessive movepool to command strategies that its erstwhile responsibilities spared the aforementioned Tier from

Offense
Mewtwo @ Adrenaline Orb  
Ability: psychicpower  
EVs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe  
Timid Nature  
- Psystrike / Stored Power  
- infernobeam / Aura Sphere  
- Aurora Beam / Water Sport 
- Night Daze / Comeuppance

Strengths
√ Psystrike allows Mewtwo to deal massive damage to opposing set-up Sweepers and Walls; Stored Power has more immediate strength
√ Inferno Beam annihilates Dialga, while also dealing good damage to opposing Steel Walls; Aura Sphere hits Arceus and Dark-Types
√ Aurora Beam hits more threats Super-Effectively, including some quadruple-weak foes; Water Sport is powerful enough to serve as an auxillary pseudo-stab move for opponents that can survive the rest of its moveset
√ Night Daze and Comeuppance both allow Mewtwo to nail opposing Psychics; Night Daze is more consistent and has better coverage, while Comeuppance hits significantly harder

Weaknesses
✘ Mewtwo may miss certain K.O.s if it elects to run Psystrike; Stored Power hits harder, but experiences more hard counters from various walls or specially defensive set-up sweepers
✘ Inferno Beam is needed to consistently nail Dialga and hit most Steels, while Aura Sphere is important for Arceus and Darks
✘ Aurora Beam has good coverage, but has an otherwise unimpressive BP; Water Sport hits less relevant threats
✘ Comeuppance can destroy some threats that can otherwise cope with Night Daze, however it is otherwise rather exploitable; Night Daze is safer, but the drop in power is noticeable

Defensive/StallTwo
Mewtwo @ Leftovers / Adrenaline Orb 
Ability: psychicpower  
EVs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe  
Timid Nature  
IVs: 0 Atk  
- Psystrike / Psycho Fire
- Ember / Psycho Darts
- Nasty Plot / Ember / Aurora Beam / Taunt
- Recover

Strengths
√ Psystrike allows Mewtwo to erase opposing Set-Up mons that may try to hinder it, while Psycho Fire has more immediate power against opposing Steel-Types
√ Ember is necessary, and allows Mewtwo to cripple opposing Walls and Physical Attackers, while helping it position naturally bulky Pokemon like Arceus into ranges that allow Psystrike/Psycho Fire to 2HKO
√ Nasty Plot allows Mewtwo to capitalize on its tremendous natural Special Attack and Speed to potentially sweep; If Mewtwo is running Leftovers, it may be necessary to allow it to apply pressure to naturally bulky walls; Aurora Beam can also be run to quickly delete quadruply-weak threats
√ Recover is mandatory, and allows Mewtwo to stall most efficiently, particularly through Ember-Stalling otherwise problematic Physical Attackers, or healing in front of certain Walls.

Weaknesses
✘ Pokemon that can outspeed Mewtwo before it can land an Ember pose a real threat to it, as certain Physical Attackers can 2HKO it even with a Burn; Faster Special Attackers, likewise, force Mewtwo to either switch or attempt to K.O. them outright, potentially leaving Mewtwo in a disadvantageous position even if it wins.
✘ Psycho Darts allows Mewtwo to delete Porygon-Z and potentially chip away at weakened faster threats, but forces Mewtwo to sacrifice Nasty Plot
✘ Aurora Beam may be preferred if Mewtwo needs to dispatch a quadruply-weak Pokemon that has become too powerful for the other Teammates to effectively manage, however, without Nasty Plot, certain Walls become impassable
✘ Mewtwo must eschew utilizing its massive offensive coverage--including coverage for opposing Psychic-Types--to effectively run a Stall set, significantly worsening its matchups against opposing Darks, Psychics, and Mewtwo, specifically
=====================================================================================================================

						     Section C     
						   Limited Ubers

Description: The Tier List for the Pokemon Memories Meta before the introduction of Memorization. Once the mechanic was added to the game, the original Format, without the Memory Discs, became the "Limited"-line of Metagames that are currently on the ladder. As the Limited Meta is no longer the Standard Meta in the game; The pre-Memorize Tier List has been preserved for use in discerning the viability for Pokemon in this Format.

Note: The following placements represent the viability of the Pokemon, as assessed prior to the introduction of Memorization. As such, certain placements may be inaccurate, or outdated, including in the Limited Meta itself, as additional Balance Updates and Meta Developments may have affected the Meta. This list should not, therefore, be interpreted as the definitive Viability Rankings for Non-Memorized Pokemon; The Standard Tier List will offer a more accurate assessment of this.

(150 Total - Limited)

							S-Tier

							Mewtwo
					              [ Psychic ]
			    (Hp: 170/Atk: 335/Def: 185/SpA: 338/SpD: 185/Spe: 187) BST: 1400
					     Pressure/Unnerve/Psychic Power


Description: Between its peerless offenses, blistering speed, and its perfectly distributed defenses; Mewtwo is an unparallaled force of mass destruction in this Meta. Whereas most Pokemon are biased toward specific sets, which serve as the primary cause for their exalted viability; Mewtwo is able to continuously adapt its sets on the fly, allowing it to always keep its opponents guessing. Its perfectly placed stats leave it with no major vulnerabilites, and its access to a nearly unlimited movepool, encompassing every Type in the game, makes it nigh uncounterable. Simply figuring out the opposing Mewtwo's set, is itself, a daunting undertaking, and actually managing to successfully faint it, is something that will usually only be possible after a very long struggle between both sides. Mewtwo's combination of attributes makes it a force to be reckoned with, and when paired with its dangerous unpredictability, powerful teammates, signature items, and phenomenal ability; This Genetic Masterpiece proves itself to be a powerful Pokemon that is second to none. We dreamed of creating the most powerful Pokemon, and we succeeded.


							Kyogre
						       [ Water ]
			    (Hp: 160/Atk: 240/Def: 180/SpA: 320/SpD: 280/Spe: 160) BST: 1340
					           Drizzle/Antipathy

Description: Thanks to its fantastic Special Attack stat, amazing Typing, access to the powerful Water Spout, and its amazing Ability, Drizzle; Kyogre is a menace to fight against, and is one of the most dangerous Pokemon in the game. With Choice Scarf, and a set of Water Spout/Origin Pulse/Thunder/Ice Beam, Kyogre is capable of shredding through almost anything that isn't a dedicated resist, through the power of its high BP moves, and impressive coverage. Kyogre can also run Choice Specs to punish players that were expecting a Scarfed set, and hit the Tier even harder. Wave Incense sacrifices the speed of Scarf, and the power of Specs, but grants Kyogre incredible power with its Water-Type moves, without locking it out of the rest of its set. Finally, and best of all, is its Sea Incense set; With a set of Origin Pulse/Thunder/Rain Dance/Thunder Wave, Kyogre can not only outspeed all but the more obscure Pokemon due to the Sea Incense boost, but can exploit its deadly combination of Rain and Paralysis to potentially cripple, or even check its own dedicated answers, allowing it to wreak havoc with its powerful attacking moves. Its amazing ability to threaten the entire tier, whilst potentially enabling certain teams through its Rain setting utility, not only makes Kyogre one of the best Pokemon in the game, but far and away, the most centralizing.


							Dialga
						    [Steel/Dragon]
			    (Hp: 230/Atk: 280/Def: 210/SpA: 280/SpD: 180/Spe: 160) BST: 1340
					     Pressure/Telepathy/Regenerator


Description: Dialga's massive defensive stats, stratospheric offenses, and excellent Type-Combination already make it a force to be reckoned with, however what truly sets it apart from the rest of its peers is access to the best Ability, and one of the best moves in the game--in Regenerator and Shell Smash respectively. Thanks to these two powerful resources, Dialga is capable of fulfilling a multitude of roles, from bulky tank, dedicated offense, hazard support, or even various hybrids of these sets--all while maintaining its Ability to perform excellently during games, and even potentially sweep the opponent. Dialga's ability to run nearly any kind of set--including frightening mixed sets, while synergizing with nearly every viable Item in the Tier--is unrivaled, and it is easily the most customizable Pokemon in the entire game. When building a Team, it is vital that players prepare an answer for this Master of Time, lest they find their ephemeral existence ground to dust.


						     Calyrex-Shadow
						     [Psychic/Ghost]
			    (Hp: 180/Atk: 250/Def: 180/SpA: 350/SpD: 260/Spe: 180) BST: 1400
					    Power Spot/Double-Layer/Antipathy


Description: In addition to having a dangerous Psychic/Ghost Type-Combination; Calyrex-Shadow also possesses an incredible Speed Stat, and one of the highest Special Attack stats in the entire game. Because of the incredible power it possesses, particularly through its devastating Astral Barrage, and Psycho Boost, Calyrex often doesn't even need to hold a damage-boosting Item to deal massive amounts of damage, and will often place immense pressure on opposing Teams through its sheer presence alone. Calyrex also has access to its signature Elemental Stones, which grant it a x1.2 boost on all of its attacks, grants Hyper Beam perfect accuracy, and changes Hyper Beam's Type to match the type of the compatible stone it is holding. This grants Calyrex a high degree of unpredictability, and further allows it to potentially defeat Pokemon that would otherwise give it trouble, such as Yveltal. While Astral Barage will no longer boost Calyrex's Special Attack, if it has at least +1 in its Special Attack, already, it is still an incredibly potent Snowballing tool, especially when paired with its new Ability, Power Spot, which grants Calyrex's moves a 50% power boost, if it has been reduced to 1/4 or less of its Max HP. Calyrex is one of the best Offensive Utility, and Late-Game Cleaner Pokemon in the game, and players would do well to prepare themselves for this menace.



						     Tier Assesments
S-Tier: Reserved for the absolute most powerful Pokemon; These Pokemon can fit on to every Team and immediately improve the group's viability through its presence alone, having the potential not only to fortify already powerful Teams, but elevate to viability Teams, Pokemon, and strategies that would otherwise be suboptimal without them. There are few, if any downsides to selecting a Pokemon from this Tier, and it is crucial that opponents have answers to these threats if their Team is to gain any traction in the Meta. 

A-Tier: Reserved for exemplary Pokemon that either fulfil a multitude of roles, or accomplish their specific roles with with peerless excellence. Pokemon in this Tier tend to have only minor weaknesses, all of which are almost completely compensated for by the immense utility provided for players' Teams. These are the Electrons that orbit the Nuclei of the Tier, and players will want to have at least one of these Pokemon on their Team if they hope to gain any traction in the Meta.

B-Tier: Reserved for Pokemon that serve noticeable functions in the Meta, with varying degrees of success. Many of the Pokemon in this Tier have profound, or even rare strengths which cannot be found in the A-Tier proper, but possess glaring weaknesses that prevent them from gaining a spot in the aforementioned Tier themselves. Strategic play and additional support may be required to bring out these Pokemons' full potential, however when played optimally, they may be able to give Players the particular utility they'll need to gain traction in the Meta.

C-Tier: Reserved for Pokemon that are capable of fulfilling certain roles with a certain degree of success, but lack either the consistency or environment to fully capitalize on their positive attributes. These Pokemon are typically outclassed by the Pokemon in the Tiers above them due to either lacking a sufficient number of relevant strengths, or possessing too many exploitable weaknessness, however many of these Pokemon may be capable of rising to one of the higher Tiers, should either the meta change, or new sets end up being discovered within their current Meta. These Pokemon may require considerable skill to play, but might just provide the necessary resources to help players gain traction in the Meta.

D-Tier: Reserved for Pokemon that are almost completely outclassed by the Pokemon in the Tiers above them due to a number of intrinsic factors, which may never be completely remedied even with new set discoveries or drastic Meta changes. Pokemon often merit this Tier, due to either insufficient stats, poor typing(s), insufficient movepools, or being completely outclassed in the few roles they do have, by other, significantly more powerful Pokemon, among which, may even be variants of themselves. Researching these Pokemon may be helpful, should an opponent endeavor to use one of these Pokemon in a game, however well-designed Teams will likely have resources that can handle one, or even many of these Pokemon, regardless. As such, these Pokemon are not helpful for gaining any traction in the Meta.

Unranked: Reserved for Pokemon that were experimented with during development, but failed to meet the Meta's standard to justify placement in a proper Tier; Since this game is primarily balanced around Ubers, it could be entirely possible for these Pokemon to be viable in lower Tiers, however in this Tier, these Pokemon fail to accomplish anything of value, and should realistically never be used if Players hope to gain any traction in the Meta.

						History of the Format
Description
While Limited Ubers is still available as a playable Format on the Ladder, it is officially treated as a Legacy, or Discontinued Format, and as such, the Tier List for it represents the viability of the Pokemon as they were in the Final Patch for "Pokemon Forces", before the project was updated into Pokemon Memories

Notable Differences
Dialga
Up until near the very end of Pokemon Forces' initial run, Shell Smash--just like in the Mainline Games, lasted indefinitely... Whichever opponents Dialga could not defeat through sheer power alone, it could easily overwhelm through several turns of attrition wherein Walls of varying levels of strength were forced to juggle their desperate attempts to Recover against the necessity to attack the opposing Dialga themselves, which would only benefit them so much, as, per the Mainline Mechanics, it could also switch out...

Kyogre
Meowscarada had not been created at the time, and as such, was not present to limit its power, furthermore, since Tailwind was still unviable at the time, and Wind Streamer did not exist, Utility Lock did not have the power to neutralize it, and as such, Vaporeon was only a liability. The absence of Memorization and a viable ScarfRex further exacerbated the problem, as its checks were limited to handful of Pokemon, the most centralizing of which was Tapu Fini

Meloetta
Once the only Pokemon capable of pushing both Calyrex-Shadow, and the powerful Mewtwo back. Entire games would be determined by each Team's management of their respective Mewtwos, Calyrexs, and Meloettas, with each Pokemon running gimmicky sets, such as EV-Invested Odd Incense Mewtwo, or Invested Weakness Policy Calyrex, specifically in hopes of checking it. The fall of a Trainer's Meloetta presaged the impending conclusion of the game

Mewtwo
Despite lacking Hightened Mind, and having a more limited movepool in Forces, the more centralized metagame allowed Mewtwo to wield its greatest weapon, in consistency. Mewtwo, Calyrex-Shadow, and Meloetta collectively composed a Matchup-Triangle, of which Mewtwo received the most benefit, for while Scarfed Caly-S could theoretically check Mewtwo, it was countered by Meloetta, which was primarily used to check Mewtwo--who, in turn, could check the non-Scarfed Caly-S sets that were designed to answer Meloetta, while also potentially answering Meloetta itself with its Bug-Type Moves, should it so choose. Because of this, games ultimately revolved around the mangement of each player's respective Meloetta and Mewtwo, as the player who lost their Meloetta--and couldn't force and win the following Mewtwo Speed Tie--usually lost the game.

Torterra
For most of its existence, Flower Sweet did not discriminate between Mono-Grass Types, and Dual-Typed Pokemon, which, paired with Torterra's higher stats at the time, led to it arguably becoming even stronger than both Kyogre and Mewtwo. The Torterra mentioned in the Limited Ubers Tier List actually represents its estimated viability after the nerfs imposed upon Flower Sweet.
