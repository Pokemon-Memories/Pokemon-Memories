						      Highlights
Description: Certain Pokemon are given "Highlights", which will be posted here. A Pokemon may be highlighted from any Tier, however, typically, they are chosen from the S-Tier. The Highlighted Pokemon's attributes are listed in the following order: Species, [Type], (Stats), Abilities, and [Viable Memory Discs].


							S-Tier

							Mewtwo
					              [ Psychic ]
			    	(Hp: 170/Atk: 335/Def: 185/SpA: 338/SpD: 185/Spe: 187) BST: 1400
					    Psychic Power/Oppression/Unnerve
 			  [Dark Memory/Dubious Disc/Fairy Memory/Fighting Memory/Ghost Memory]
				[Ground Memory/Ice Memory/Poison Memory/Psychic Memory]


Description: Between its peerless offenses, blistering speed, and its perfectly distributed defenses; Mewtwo is an unparallaled force of mass destruction in this Meta. Whereas most Pokemon are biased toward specific sets, which serve as the primary cause for their exalted viability; Mewtwo is able to continuously adapt its sets on the fly, allowing it to always keep its opponents guessing. Its perfectly placed stats leave it with no major vulnerabilites, and its access to a nearly unlimited movepool, encompassing every Type in the game, makes it nigh uncounterable. Simply figuring out the opposing Mewtwo's set, is itself, a daunting undertaking, and actually managing to successfully faint it, is something that will usually only be possible after a very long struggle between both sides. Mewtwo's combination of attributes make it a force to be reckoned with, and when paired with its dangerous unpredictability, powerful teammates, signature items, and phenomenal ability; This Genetic Masterpiece proves itself to be a powerful Pokemon that is second to none. We dreamed of creating the most powerful Pokemon, and we succeeded.


						      Meowscarada
						      [Grass/Dark]
			    	(Hp: 166/Atk: 270/Def: 150/SpA: 261/SpD: 170/Spe: 181) BST: 1198
						  Parlor Trick/Protean

Description: A Support Pokemon at heart: Meowscarada's incredible Speed allows it to perform its Tricks on almost any Pokemon, with impunity, while its Grass/Dark Typing makes it into one of the most important Defensive Support Pokemon in the game. Thanks to its aforementioned Type Combination, alongside its ability, Parlor Trick, Meowscarada is not only able to check opposing Calyrex-Shadow and Kyogre, but can even potentially tank a Fully Invested Adamant Sunsteel Strike from a +2 Atk Steel Memory Necrozma Dusk Mane--provided that it has been weakened beforehand, In addition to its Defensive Support capabilities; Meowscarada is also a fantastic Offensive Support Pokemon, being able to boost its speed with Trailblaze, or deal heavy damage to threats like Landorus-Therian, or opposing Meowscarada, through Slush Switch, respectively. Best of all, however, is its signature move, Flower Trick, which allows Meowscarada to change a Pokemon's Type, and lower both of their Defenses, while directly reducing their damage output for the Turn; A set of properties that Meowscarada is able to exploit, to weaken walls for itself or allies, endure otherwise fatal hits, or even cripple Pokemon that relied on Elemental Orbs as their primary source of power, such as Tapu Koko, or Entei. Meowscarada is the single best disruptor in the game, and may even be the best Pokemon in the game. No matter what Team one goes up against, Meowscarada is almost certain to be of use to its Teammates, and those who underestimate this Trickster, may soon find that the Joke is on them.


						     Calyrex-Shadow
						     [Psychic/Ghost]
			    	(Hp: 180/Atk: 270/Def: 160/SpA: 350/SpD: 260/Spe: 180) BST: 1400
					    Power Spot/Double-Layer/Antipathy
					       [Ghost Memory/Fairy Memory]


Description: In addition to having a dangerous Psychic/Ghost Type-Combination; Calyrex-Shadow also possesses an incredible Speed Stat, and one of the highest Special Attack stats in the game. Because of the incredible power it possesses, particularly through its devastating Astral Barrage, and Psycho Boost, Calyrex often doesn't even need to hold a damage-boosting Item to deal massive amounts of damage, and is easily capable of applying immense pressure on opposing Teams through its sheer presence alone. With its massive Speed Stat, Calyrex is capable of outspeeding almost every viable Pokemon in the game, and with a Choice Scarf in its possession, it is capable of even leaving foes like Mewtwo in the dust. In keeping with its Ghost-Typing, Calyrex has a few more tricks up its sleeves; With its Elemental Stones, Calyrex-Shadow can change the Type of its Hyper Beam, to potentially allow it to shred through foes such as Yveltal, Genesect, or Ho-Oh, while its limited, yet potent--Memorization skills, allow it to augment either its coverage, or power, to the point where even the sturdiest Teams can find themselves brought to kneel before this High King. Calyrex-Shadow may not excel in unpredictability, but across all of its sets, it is surprisingly versatile, and those who leave themselves vulnerable to its powerful offensive onslaughts, will find themselves left with a Team full of Ghost-Types.


							Arceus
					               [Normal]
			    	(Hp: 200/Atk: 300/Def: 210/SpA: 300/SpD: 210/Spe: 180) BST: 1400
						 Multitype/Impervious
					       [Dubious Disc/Up-Grade]


Description: While Mewtwo uses its 1400 BST to emphasize Offense; Arceus optimizes its Base Stat Distribution to ensure it can be as versatile, and flexible as possible. Arceus' incredible Base 180 Speed, paired with its Base 300 offenses, allows it to outspeed, and imperil almost every relevant threat in the entire metagame, while its nearly limitless movepool, and access to Heaven Dance, ensures that no single Defensive countermeasure against this Pokemon, is ever certain. While there are a number of Pokemon that also have comparable levels of power to Arceus, what truly elevates it above its peers, are its exceptional bulk, and access to the Ability, Impervious, which allows it to gain an Immunity to whatever Type Arceus is holding a Damage-Reducing Berry for. Because of these two factors; Even should the opponent find a way to overcome--or surpass Arceus' Speed, so as to dare try attacking it, there is no guarantee that such trifling buffets from the Mortals beneath it will even be effective, let alone fruitful. Between its immeasurable movepool, innumerable Multitypes, and its powerful Dubious Disc; Arceus is never a Pokemon that one should dare approach irreverantly, and those who fail to approach it with the proper discretion, will face a swift, and extreme, Judgment.


							Dialga
						    [Steel/Dragon]
			        (Hp: 230/Atk: 280/Def: 210/SpA: 280/SpD: 180/Spe: 160) BST: 1340
					     Pressure/Telepathy/Regenerator
			      [Dark Memory/Dubious Disc/Fairy Memory/Ice Memory/Rock Memory]


Description: Dialga's massive defensive stats, stratospheric offenses, and excellent Type-Combination already make it a force to be reckoned with, however what truly sets it apart from the rest of its peers is access to one of the best Abilities, and one of the best moves in the game--in Regenerator and Shell Smash respectively. Thanks to these two powerful resources, Dialga is capable of fulfilling a multitude of roles, from bulky tank, dedicated offense, hazard support, or even various hybrids of these sets--all while maintaining its Ability to perform excellently during games, and even potentially sweep through the opponent's Team. Dialga's ability to run nearly any kind of set--including frightening mixed sets, while synergizing with nearly every viable Item in the Tier--is unrivaled, and it is easily the most customizable Pokemon in the entire game. When building a Team, it is vital that players prepare an answer for this Master of Time, lest they find their ephemeral existence ground to dust.


							Zekrom
						   [Dragon/Electric]
			    	(Hp: 160/Atk: 270/Def: 240/SpA: 225/SpD: 180/Spe: 175) BST: 1250
					    Teravolt/Tinted Lens/Double-Layer
					     [Electric Memory/Dark Memory]


Description: Zekrom's blistering Speed Tier, paired with its powerful Bolt Strike, three viable abilities, Light Ball, and access to Dragon Dance, all coalesce to make it into one of the most dangerous Setup Sweepers in the Meta. If Zekrom is able to get even a single Dragon Dance boost, there is almost nothing that will be able to stand up to it, and even without a boost, the overwhelming power of Bolt Strike alone, paired with its above average physical Defenses, are more than enough to ensure that its foes are never entirely safe around it. In addition to the power of its Signature Electric Stab, Zekrom also has access to the elusive Royal Rampage, a powerful Dragon-Type move, that allows it hit Steel-Types neutrally, and thus, potentially annihilate threats that could otherwise endure its powerful Electric Moves, such as Dialga. Zekrom is also one of the best Memory Abusers in the game; With an Electric Memory, Zekrom is able to ameliorate its Electric Typing's offensive insufficiencies, through its newfound ability to bypass the Ground-Type's immunity to its moves, while its Dark Memory, in addition to drastically increasing its coverage, and power--allows it to terrorize opposing Psychic-Types, such as Cresselia, while gaining a resistance to all of Calyrex-Shadow's STAB moves. Opposing Scarfers, such as Calyrex-Shadow, may cause its power to be constrained, somewhat, however the player that is able to utilize Zekrom effectively, will have in their possession, one of the strongest forces of mass-destruction that one could ask for.




						     Tier Assesments
S-Tier: Reserved for the absolute most powerful Pokemon; These Pokemon can fit on to every Team and immediately improve the group's viability through its presence alone, having the potential not only to fortify already powerful Teams, but elevate to viability Teams, Pokemon, and strategies that would otherwise be suboptimal without them. There are few, if any downsides to selecting a Pokemon from this Tier, and it is crucial that opponents have answers to these threats if their Team is to gain any traction in the Meta. 

A-Tier: Reserved for exemplary Pokemon that either fulfil a multitude of roles, or accomplish their specific roles with with peerless excellence. Pokemon in this Tier tend to have only minor weaknesses, all of which are almost completely compensated for by the immense utility provided for players' Teams. These are the Electrons that orbit the Nuclei of the Tier, and players will want to have at least one of these Pokemon on their Team if they hope to gain any traction in the Meta.

B-Tier: Reserved for Pokemon that serve noticeable functions in the Meta, with varying degrees of success. Many of the Pokemon in this Tier have profound, or even rare strengths which cannot be found in the A-Tier proper, but possess glaring weaknesses that prevent them from gaining a spot in the aforementioned Tier themselves. Strategic play and additional support may be required to bring out these Pokemons' full potential, however when played optimally, they may be able to give Players the particular utility they'll need to gain traction in the Meta.

C-Tier: Reserved for Pokemon that are capable of fulfilling certain roles with a certain degree of success, but lack either the consistency or environment to fully capitalize on their positive attributes. These Pokemon are typically outclassed by the Pokemon in the Tiers above them due to either lacking a sufficient number of relevant strengths, or possessing too many exploitable weaknessness, however many of these Pokemon may be capable of rising to one of the higher Tiers, should either the meta change, or new sets end up being discovered within their current Meta. These Pokemon may require considerable skill to play, but might just provide the necessary resources to help players gain traction in the Meta.

D-Tier: Reserved for Pokemon that are almost completely outclassed by the Pokemon in the Tiers above them due to a number of intrinsic factors, which may never be completely remedied even with new set discoveries or drastic Meta changes. Pokemon often merit this Tier, due to either insufficient stats, poor typing(s), insufficient movepools, or being completely outclassed in the few roles they do have, by other, significantly more powerful Pokemon, among which, may even be variants of themselves. Researching these Pokemon may be helpful, should an opponent endeavor to use one of these Pokemon in a game, however well-designed Teams will likely have resources that can handle one, or even many of these Pokemon, regardless. As such, these Pokemon are not helpful for gaining any traction in the Meta.

Unranked: Reserved for Pokemon that were experimented with during development, but failed to meet the Meta's standard to justify placement in a proper Tier; Since this game is primarily balanced around Ubers, it could be entirely possible for these Pokemon to be viable in lower Tiers, however in this Tier, these Pokemon fail to accomplish anything of value, and should realistically never be used if Players hope to gain any traction in the Meta.

Conditional Placements: If a Pokemon that would otherwise reside in a lower Tier, finds itself worthy the A-Tier on account of its synergy with the Memorize Mechanic; Next to the Pokemon's name will be the letter of the Tier they would have otherwise resided in, alongside, if applicable, the particular Held Item, or Memory Mechanic(s) (e.g. Items, Abilities, etc) that contributed to their higher placement. (E.g.: PokePoke (D; Bug Memory)).

Note: Pokemon beneath the A-Tier, are listed alphabetically; Pokemon in the lower Tiers are assessed based on their Viability in their Standard Formes; Potential Memory Placements, will not be factored, unless they are sufficient to elevate them to the A-Tier.

						Memorization Ratings
Summary: Measures the benefit that a particular Pokemon derives from the Memorization Mechanic. Tiering is divided into three categories: Ratings, which are categorical, and observe the particular benefit Memorizing certain Pokemon has for the Team; Priority, which measures the order of consideration Players should give in assessing whether to Memorize a particular Pokemon, if a Player has it on their Team; And Dependence, which are individualized ratings, which represent the dependence of a Pokemon on the Mechanic, to justify their usage at all.

Ratings
Excellent - This Pokemon is an exceptional Memorization user, and is easily worth the Team's Memory Slot
Good - This Pokemon is an powerful Memorization user, and is a worthy user of the Team's Memory Slot
Average - Memorization modifies the Pokemon's Matchups, but doesn't significantly benefit them. Situationally useful.
No Benefit - Memorization either doesn't improve, or actively compromises the Pokemon. Generally not worth the slot.

Priority
0 - This Pokemon does not need to be Memorized
1 - This Pokemon is a Low-Priority for Memorization
2 - This Pokemon should be considered for Memorization
3 - Players should strongly consider Memorizing this Pokemon
4 - This Pokemon is a Top-Candidate for Memorization

Dependence
0 - Pokemon may benefit from Memorizing, but possesses a similar level of viability, even without its use.
1 - Pokemon's viability is positively affected by Memorizing, however it can still function on its own.
2 - Pokemon's viability is significantly impacted by Memorization, and will experience difficulties without it.
3 - Pokemon's usefulness is primarily, if not entirely dependent on Memorizing, and should not be used without it.

Key: P represents Priority, and D represents Dependence; The number in Paranthesis, is the sum of both P, and D.
Note: This is not a standard Viability Ranking; The following placements are indicative of their viability as Memory Users, not their overall viability, relative to other Pokemon; Pokemon within a Category are sorted Alphabetically

					    Kyogre-Check (Sponsors) Tier List
Summary: Measures how effectively certain Pokemon can handle Kyogre, while still providing valuable utility to the rest of the Team. Absolute checks may therefore be ranked lower than weaker checks, if they fail to provide significant utility to the Team beyond singularly checking Kyogre.

S-Class: Reserved for Pokemon that can not only consistently check Kyogre, but are capable of excelling in the Meta and substantially benefitting Teams even if Kyogre is absent. For these Pokemon, checking Kyogre is only one of many things that they can do, and they would still serve as indispensible members of players' Teams, even without a Kyogre to manage.

A-Class: Reserved for Pokemon that can most efficently check Kyogre whilst still providing utility to the player's Team; These Pokemon's viability is heightened by their matchup against Kyogre, but isn't contigent upon it.

B-Class: Pokemon in this class tend to do excellent jobs at checking Kyogre in a vacuum, but possess other significant weaknesses that create a significant opportunity cost when using them for this role. Pokemon can also end up in this Tier if they have otherwise favorable matchups against the rest of the Tier, but only check Kyogre under certain circumstances.

C-Class: Pokemon in this Tier can check, and even counter some of Kyogre's moves, but otherwise tend to have inconsistent or unreliable matchups against the rest of the Tier.

						     Setpedia
Summary: This is a resource designed to assess certain Pokemons' lists of known viable moves, and battle strategies. Due to the number of Pokemon in the game: Not every Pokemon will receive a highlight, however Pokemon that stand out as being noteworthy, or powerful, will receive mention here.

- Iron Head
- Draco Meteor
- Flash Cannon
- Stealth Rock
- Aura Sphere
- Fire Blast

Preferred Ability
Regenerator

Strengths
- Solid Bulk
- Massive Damage Output, once boosted
- Multiple chances to safely interact, due to Regenerator
- Dawn Stone +2 Draco Meteor is one of the strongest moves in the game
- Decent coverage
- Can viably run Mixed Sets
- Its Typing, combined with its bulk, allows it to check Kyogre, Xerneas, and Eternatus, under certain circumstances

Weaknesses
- Middling Speed-Tier, coupled with an exploitable Steel-Typing
- Insignificant Damage Output when unboosted
- Its Dragon moves have halved power under Hail, effectively cutting its power in half
- Cannot switch out for 3 turns after using Shell Smash; All boosts reset after 3 turns (Cannot escape with Shed Shell)
- Extremely vulnerable to Low Sweep, especially from Gallade, Urshifu, and certain Mewtwo sets
- Almost unwinnable matchup against Suicune, and Urshifu-R (and to a lesser extent, Urshifu-S).

Dubious Disc
Strengths
- Eliminates all of Dialga's Weaknesses, enabling it to take full advantage of its colossal Bulk
- Particularly, it significantly improves Dialga's Matchup against Lando-T, and Fighting-Types
- It's peerless Bulk not only allows Dialga to invest more offensively, but makes its Thunder Wave sets more consistent
- Due to the power of Oversight, Dialga can afford to exclusively run ???-Type Moves, without compromising its Power
- With both Memory Blast, and Facade: Dialga can hit opponents for more immediate Damage, with Memory Blast, while decimating Dragon Breath users, or Burn inflicters, with Facade
- Between its massive defenses, lack of weaknesses, and access to Regenerator: Dialga will not faint if it doesn't want to

Weaknesses
- Loses all of its Resistances, and immunities, making it vulnerable to Dragon Breath's Poison Status, while completely removing its Ability to consistently check certain Pokemon, such as Kyogre.
- While Dialga's Typing means that it takes less Damage in extreme circumstances, it also causes Dialga to take more Damage, on average, causing it to rely more on switching, in order to keep itself healthy, with Regenerator
- Particularly noteworthy vulnerabilities, include Arceus' Extreme Speed, and Toxic Orb Sheer Force Bellsprout's Poison Sting, both of which can hit Dialga neutrally, for massive damage, especially after Dialga has used Shell Smash
- This causes Dubious Disc Dialga to function more as an OHKO-Safeguard, than as a direct defensive upgrade to Base Dialga 

Fairy Memory
Strengths
- Its Fairy-Typing allows Dialga to turn losing Matchups, such as against Gallade, and Marshadow, into positive ones
- Removes all drawbacks from Draco Meteor
- Enables it to challenge Pokemon that would otherwise give it trouble, Defensively, such as Cresselia, and Articuno-G
- Can survive any commonly run move from Mewtwo, at full health

Weaknesses
- Worsens Dialga's Matchup against Pokemon it would normally check, such as Eternatus
- Loses most of its utility as a Kyogre sponge, due to losing its Dragon-Typing
- Increased vulnerability to Mewtwo's Stored Power, and Calyrex-Shadow's Psycho Boost

Ice Memory
Strengths
- Almost completely invaldates opposing Scarf Palkia sets (however Fire Blast will still annoy it, somewhat)
- Memory Blast enables Dialga to consistently break through opposing Landorus, even after a Pacify/Inveigle drop
- Significantly improved Special Bulk, to the point where almost nothing can OHKO it, on the Special side.
- The Ice-Type's massive coverage enables Dialga to use its otherwise riskier Steel coverage, enabling it to annihilate opposing Fairy-Types, such as Xerneas.
- Shares similar resistances to Base Dialga, such as Bug, Flying, Normal, and Water, while removing its Ground Weakness, making it a direct upgrade to Base Dialga, in certain Matchups 

Weaknesses
- While it shares many of Base Dialga's resistances, it also loses a number of resistances, such as Psychic, and Electric, worsening its Matchups against Pokemon like Zekrom, and certain Mewtwo sets
- Furthermore, its Steel resistance also becomes a weakness, making it vulnerable to priority Bullet Punch users, and in some situations, even opposing Dialga.
- Additionally, it loses its Poison immunity, reducing its effectiveness as a Dragon Breath sponge, while leaving it vulnerable to Bellsprout's Poison Sting
- Gains Rock-Type weakness, and by extension, a weakness to Stealth Rock, which can potentially limit its survivability

Rock Memory
Strengths
- Turns Ho-Oh from a losing Matchup, into a winning one, for Dialga, to where it can even serve as a switch-in for it.
- Provides coverage to bypass many of its common checks, similarly to the Fairy Memory
- Additionally, it allows Dialga to nail Ho-Oh, Rayquaza, and Entei* (when boosted), with a single move

Weaknesses
- Less relevant resistances than Fairy Memory. Particularly, its Matchup against opposing Dialga is potentially worsened
- Loses most of its utility as a Kyogre sponge, due to losing its Dragon-Typing
- Increased vulnerability to Mewtwo's Stored Power, and Calyrex-Shadow's Psycho Boost

Zekrom
Common Items
- Light Ball
- Life Orb
- Ice Gem
- Dawn Stone

Common Memories
- Dark Memory
- Electric Memory

Common Moves
Constant = Dragon Dance
- Bolt Strike
- Royal Rampage
- Flying Deluge
- Slush Switch
- Ice Punch
- Blizzard
- Fusion Bolt

Preferred Ability
Teravolt

Strengths
- Decent Offensive Typing
- Bolt Strike deals massive damage, even when unboosted (provided it is holding a Light Ball)
- Fantastic Speed
- Incredible Physical Bulk
- Teravolt allows Zekrom to bypass abilities, and force its way past potential checks under certain circumstances
- Has access to Pivoting moves
- Royal Rampage allows Zekrom to OHKO Dialga, and ignore Protector, without sacrificing its STAB, or a move slot
- Flying Deluge allows it to hit both Lando-T, and Ho-Oh for x4 damage, improving its Matchups against them
- Double-Layer, when paired with a Utility Umbrella, allows Zekrom to check most Kyogre sets, including its dangerous Sea Incense Thunder Wave sets

Weaknesses
- Limited Movepool, with the moves it does have either being unviable or redundant.
- Predictable Sets
- Awkward Defensive Typing
- Inconsistent Offensive Typing
- Needs Light Ball to be a significant offensive threat

Dark Memory
Strengths
- Ameliorates Zekrom's dubious Defensive Typing, notably allowing it to take boosted hits from Calyrex-Shadow
- Its three STABs hit nearly every Pokemon in the game, and can annihilate most of them, when boosted
- One of the most dangerous Set-Up Sweepers in the game; Can potentially sweep entire Teams, if they lack an answer
- Incredible Bulk, paired with its Memory Ability, allows it to tank many Super-Effective Priority Moves
- Oftentimes doesn't even need Dragon Dance to begin its sweep, due to Royal Rampage's speed boost

Weaknesses
- 4MSS: Without Ice Punch or Flying Deluge, Zekrom gets walled by Landorus; Without Royal Rampage, Dialga can beat it
- Increased vulnerability to Priority Moves, most notably, Low Sweep, and Bullet Seed
- Has difficulty dealing with faster Pokemon with coverage, if it cannot raise its Speed, somehow
- Completely loses its ability to defensively check opposing Kyogre, due to being vulnerable to its STAB, and T-Wave

Electric Memory
Strengths
- Improves Zekrom's matchup against opposing Dragons, somewhat, while keeping its Thunder Wave immunity
- Comparable Power on Electric-Moves to its Light Ball sets
- Its Memory Ability, allows Zekrom to nearly completely reverse its poor Matchups against opposing Ground-Types

Weaknesses
- Worse Defensive-Typing; Completely loses its resistance to Kyogre, and gains nothing in return.
- Redundancy: Zekrom can accomplish similar feats of power with a Light Ball, without burning the Memory Slot
- Its Memory Ability, while powerful, is situational at best, as Zekrom's has a number of checks, not just Ground-Types
- Lacks the additional coverage imparted by the Dark Memory; Any non-Ground-Type 'Mon capable of handling Light Ball Zekrom, beats this.

Groudon
Common Items
- Full Incense
- Light Ball
- Gold Bottle Cap
- White Herb
- Yache Berry

Common Memories
- Fire Memory
- Ground Memory

Common Moves
Constant = Dragon Dance
- Precipice Blades
- Fire Punch
- Thunder Punch
- Swords Dance
- Stone Edge
- Rock Slide

Preferred Ability
Drought

Strengths
- Phenomenal Physical Bulk, being one of the highest in the game
- Decent Special Bulk, granting it above average bulk overall
- Amazing Offensive Typing
- Highest Basal Damage Output overall, out of all the members of the Dark Triad
- Instant access to Full Incense and Gold Bottle Cap
- Powerful exploiter of Flare Blitz, due to its massive overall bulk
- Immunity to Light Ball's Paralysis; Allowing it to use it for Thunder Punch
- Weather Support; Drought can enable Sun Teams, while frustrating other forms of Weather

Weaknesses
- Middling Speed Tier
- Highly exploitable Defensive Typing, often causing it to be a defensive liability for Teams
- Awkward Typing, given its ability; Does not synergize with the very Sun Teams it helps enable
- Poor Synergy with Teams, in general
- Massive Bulk is hindered by no relevant resistances
- Because of this, its bulk mainly just serves as a vehicle to help it set up, making it predictable
- Drought strengthens Mewtwo's Psycho Fire, allowing it to deal massive damage to it, even without dedicated coverage

Fire Memory
Strengths
- Allows Groudon to properly capitalize off of its Drought Ability, significantly increasing its power
- Changes Ice Weakness, into a Resistance, improving its Matchup against opposing Ice-Type Moves and Pokemon
- Strengthens its auxillary moves, such as Thunder Punch, due to its Memory Ability

Weaknesses
- Makes it vulnerable to Rock-Type moves, and Ground-Type moves, worsening its Matchup against other Groudon
- Doesn't accomplish much that couldn't be accomplished with a non-Memory set, despite its massive Power.
- For the aforementioned reason: This is generally not worth running, outside of very specific circumstances

Ground Memory
Strengths
- In addition to the benefits that Base Groudon has:
- Removes the need for Groudon to run Stone Edge, as its Memory Ability allows it to nail Flying-Types, regardless
- Hits harder with Ground-Type moves, than a Full Incense set, and is more consistent than a Gold Bottle Cap set

Weaknesses
- Similar weaknesses as Base Groudon.

- Adrenaline Orb
- Twisted Spoon
- Energy Powder
- Sweet Apple
- Odd Incense

- Mewtwonite Y

Common Memories
- Dark Memory
- Fairy Memory
- Fighting Memory
- Ghost Memory
- Ice Memory
- Dubious Disc
- Ground Memory
- Water Memory
- Poison Memory
- Psychic Memory

Common Moves

- Psychic Wind
- Night Daze
- Aura Sphere
- Aurora Beam
- Venoshock
- Dark Pulse
- Mineral Cannon
- Ethereal Stream
- Nasty Plot
- Trailblaze
- Brutal Swing
- Expanding Force

Strengths
- One of the highest Special Attack stats in the game
- Fastest non-Scarfed, commonly used Pokemon in the game.
- Notable outspeeds include: Caly-S, Greninja-Ash, Pikachu-Alola, Tapu Koko, Arceus, and +1 Jolly Necrozma-Dusk-Mane.
- One of the largest learnsets in the game; Has a move for every Type
- General unpredictability, with multiple viable sets, including a multitude of Memory Sets.
- Arguably the most versatile Memory-user in the game, with the largest number of known viable sets
- Extremely spammable STABs; Can sometimes run two, or even three Psychic moves, viably.
- Particularly, Psychic Storm, and Psycho Fire, grant it a Super-Effective STAB on Water, and Steel, respectively.
- Decent Bulk, which grants it greater survivability compared to Pokemon with comparable damage outputs
- Stored Power consistently hits harder than Dracolate Scarf Palkia's Boomburst, as its Ability keeps it at Full Power.
- A "charged" Expanding Force is also stronger than Palkia's Boomburst, with 240 BP, vs Dracolate Boomburst's 216.
- Incredible versatility, with arguably the greatest level of variability, behind Dialga.

Weaknesses
- Mediocre, if passible, bulk
- Irrelevant Defensive Typing, which often leaves it vulnerable to Priority moves
- Particularly, a notable vulnerability to Shadow Sneak, which Caly-S, Mega Gallade, and especially Marshadow, exploit.
- Often dependent on coverage moves to reach full effectiveness, which is only partly compensated by Psychic Power.
- Difficult to use; Applying the wrong coverage moves can result in Mewtwo having "useless" moves during a match.
- Offers little defensive synergy, often leading to scenarios where Mewtwo becomes a wallflower in matches.
- Due to its incredible viability; Most Teams will have at least some specific, or, holistic means of facing Mewtwo
- This can in turn, result in Mewtwo's Speed being "invalidated" by Scarfers, or its power, neutralized by Walls
- Furthermore, due to threats, such as Meloetta/Caly-S, and opposing Mewtwo; An anti-Psychic coverage move is mandatory
- These restrictions result in Mewtwo's otherwise unlimited variability being underutilized in a practical environment


Dark Memory
Strengths
- One of the few Memory Discs to make Mewtwo's Memory Blast stronger than Stored Power, with 234 BP vs 220 BP
- Allows Mewtwo to decimate formerly problematic Matchups, such as Cresselia, and Meloetta, with impunity
- Notably: Mewtwo can also pivot, or stay in, against Scarfed Calyrex-Shadow, under most circumstances, and win.
- Recovery gained from Mewtwo's Memory Ability, significantly improves its survivability
- Its Memory Ability also allows it to blast through even Special Walls, such as Calyrex-Ice, with ease
- The Super-Effective Damage Bonus from its Memory Ability, allows it to compensate for eschewing its Adrenaline Orb
- Gains viable access to one of the best moves in the game, in Uproar
- Fastest Uproar user in the game, allowing it to almost completely control the tempo of the match
- Gains notable resistance to opposing Dark-Type, and Ghost-Type moves, giving it a positive Matchup against Yveltal.

Weaknesses
- Increased susceptibility to Priority-Moves, as Low Sweep is both more common, and powerful, than Shadow Sneak
- Additionally, it gains a new weakness, in Grass-Type moves, and, by extension, Bullet Seed
- Worsened Matchup against Deoxys-Attack, who struggles to OHKO Base Mewtwo, but can easily one shot with Dynamic Punch
- No longer capable of out-brawling Xerneas, due to its Typing; Must either weaken it beforehand, or Uproar it out.

Fairy Memory
Strengths
- Due to the power of Fairy Aura: Mewtwo is able to effective hit harder with Memory Blast, than with a Super-Effective, Psychic Power-boosted Night Daze, allowing a 140 Atk/116 SpA/252 Spe invested Mewtwo to OHKO Calyrex-Shadow, opposing Mewtwo, and even Base Mewtwo's nemesis, Light Inversion Necrozma Dawn Wings--while having enough EVS left over in its SpA to easily tear through Steels with Psycho Fire.
- Provides complete protection from all stat drops, completely elimating Rock Tomb, and Parting Shot, as means of Speed Control, or Power Control, respectively.
- The overwhelming power of Mewtwo's Fairy Aura-boosted Memory Blast, allows Mewtwo to condense its coverage, being one of the only Mewtwo sets that doesn't necessarily require a Dark-Type move, to handle its troublesome matchups
- This allows Mewtwo--if it wishes, to potentially annihilate both Lando-T, and Ho-Oh, with Avalanche, and Mineral Cannon, respectively (Avalanche should be used over Mineral Cannon, as it bypasses Lando's Assault Vest)
- This set also synergizes well, offensively--with Speed Boosting Mewtwo variants, such as Psychic Wind sets, due to its aforementioned power

Weaknesses
- Most likely needs a way to deal with Steels, either directly, or indirectly; Opposing Dialga or Necrozma-Dusk-Mane, with Steel-Coverage, for instance, can delete Mewtwo, if it isn't careful, or prepared--against these threats
- Gets obliterated by Sheer Force Toxic Orb Bellsprout's Poison Sting, limiting its ability to run Speed Boosting sets, overall, despite offensively synergizing well with them.
- Becomes vulnerable to opposing Mewtwos' Stored Power, and Calyrex-Shadow's Psycho Boost, keeping its matchup similarly disadvantageous against a Scarfed Calyrex, while worsening its Matchup against opposing Mewtwo
- In addition to opposing Steel-Types, Mewtwo may also potentially need to have a countermeasure for Fire-Types--which also tank its Fairy Moves, as well, due to Entei being able to tank both Memory Blast, and Psycho Fire, while OHKO'ing with an Anger Point, Flame Orb-boosted Sacred Fire, in return.

Fighting Memory
Strengths
- With a set of Power-Up Punch/Trailblaze/Feint Attack; Mewtwo can annihilate most of the threats in the game; The Fourth Slot, is therefore, highly customizable. This set, however, is only one of many potentially viable ones
- Arguably the most distinctive, out of all of Mewtwo's sets, not only relative to its Memory Sets, but even its Standard Sets, due to the role it gains as a Physical Attacker
- Base Mewtwo's relatively lacklustre Physical Fighting Coverage, gets completely remedied by its access to both Memory Blast, and the Base Power Boosts that it gains, thanks to Perfect Form
- Mewtwo's incredible Fighting-STAB, paired with its Memory Ability, Perfect Form, changes Power-Up Punch from being an irrelevant move, to being one of the most dangerous moves in the game
- Power-Up Punch shreds through Pokemon like Dialga, and Empoleon, OHKO'ing them
- Thanks to the combined strength of Psychic Power, and Perfect Form, Mewtwo can OHKO Cresselia with Feint Attack
- Trailblaze allows Mewtwo to increase its speed, to beat opposing Scarfers, while also hitting hard enough to OHKO threats, like Palkia
- Has a significantly stronger Low Sweep, allowing it to more easily pick off weakened threats
- Ameloriates most of Mewtwo's issues with Priority Moves, with the remaining threats being predictable, or irrelevant.

Weaknesses
- Terrible Defensive Typing, especially since opposing Mewtwo exist; Laundry-List of Weaknesses
- Becomes Revenge-K.O. Fodder for Bellsprout, being instantly annihilated by its Sheer Force T-Orb Poison Sting.
- Being a Physically-Oriented Attacker, leaves it vulnerable to Burns, which can potentially cripple it
- Due to the negligible benefits gained from running a Special Set; Mixed Sets are somewhat inferior, compared to Mewtwo's Adrenaline Orb Sets
- Because of the aforementioned point: Mewtwo may struggle, somewhat, against physically bulky Pokemon, such as Entei--if it is lacking a Super-Effective Move--or--Stored Power, or Ho-Oh, which Mewtwo may lack the space to run Mineral Cannon for (despite being Physical: Mewtwo generally runs it on Mixed Sets, as Stored Power--paired with its other Special Moves, generally compensate for Rock's limited coverage, which is inapplicable, for Physical Sets)
- Additionally, Mewtwo has a terrible Matchup against Landorus-Therian, unless it is carrying an Ice-Type Move
- Arguably needs at least one of Psychic Wind, or Trailblaze, as otherwise, Scarfers, like Calyrex-Shadow, or Palkia, will continually force it out, while potentially stealing the momentum back from Mewtwo's Team, due to these factors.

Ghost Memory
Strengths
- Thanks to its Ghost-STAB, and the Memory Mechanic's power bonus: Poltergeist's power rivals that of Stored Power's.
- In addition to the incredible power it provides: Poltergeist significantly boosts the effectiveness of Mixed Sets.
- No longer has to worry about Normal-Types such as Meloetta, absorbing its Ghost Coverage, as it can now hit them
- Significantly improves Mewtwo's longevity, due to its Memory Ability's noteworthy healing properties
- Allows Mewtwo to serve as a potential switch-in, and answer, to non-Dubious Disc E-Killer Arceus sets
- Grants an immunity to Fighting-Type moves, and a resistance to Steel-Type moves, shielding Mewtwo completely from Fighting-Type Priority, whilst significantly weakening opposing Bullet Punches.
- Arguably the Type with the best Matchups against Priority, as most are either neutral hits, or absorbed, with Shadow Sneak being easily handled via Teammates, or even a healthy Mewtwo, under some circumstances.
- Altogether: These Type-Matchup changes, give Mewtwo a genuine defensive niche, in the Metagame

Weaknesses
- With the exception of certain Priority Moves: Mewtwo's general vulnerabilities, such as, to Scarfers, and Shadow Sneak--remain unchanged, leaving it susceptible to many of the same answers as Base Mewtwo
- Loses a noticeable amount of power--Ghost-Type moves, notwithstanding--due to forgoing Adrenaline Orb, which becomes apparent against certain Pokemon, such as Empoleon, and Bulky Dialga sets--if it isn't running Psycho Fire
- Because of these factors, while the Ghost Memory synergizes well with Mewtwo: It is fully capable of functioning, and fulfilling a nearly identical role, without it, thus, making this a potentially sub-optimal use of Memorization.


Ice Memory
Strengths
- Enables Mewtwo to serve as a potential Kyogre, and Palkia check, potentially denying Teams their only Mewtwo answer
- Bulkier Special Defense, in general, allowing it to even take hits, and respond, against mons like Scarfed Caly-S
- Allows Mewtwo to blast through even the bulkiest Inveigle Landorus-T sets, due to its overwhelming power
- Annihilates Ground-Types, and Dragon-Types, in general, due to Memory Blast being its best Ice Move
- Gains a number of useful resistances, including Flying, Ice, Water, and Normal
- This allows Mewtwo to potentially answer opposing Dragon Dance Rayquaza, and enables it to revenge kill E-Killer Arceus.
- Due to its amazing Defensive Utility: Mewtwo can viably run Recover on this set, to significantly increase its longevity
- Whereas most natural Ice-Types, are either slow, or frail: Mewtwo's solid stat distribution, combined with its limitless coverage, makes it one of the best Ice-Types in the game.

Weaknesses
- Steepest drop in Power: Ice Coverage is debatably necessary to justify the slot, however this demand, paired with the lack of Adrenaline Orb's Power Boost, potentially forces Mewtwo to drastically revamp its moveset, to function optimally
- Psychic Storm is needed to ensure Mewtwo can properly check Kyogre, Palkia, and other Water-Types, however, the relatively average Base Power of this move, paired the absence of an Adrenaline Orb to boost its power, significantly limits Mewtwo's damage output, overall. This is partially compensated for, through Memory Blast, but only partially.
- In addition to the aforementioned points: Mewtwo will likely need Recover to manage these threats, and offset its lack of immediate power, which would restrict its free coverage, to one move
- Due to this, Mewtwo particularly struggles against Steel-Types; Neither Aura Sphere, nor Psycho Fire, OHKO Empoleon, while Empoleon can OHKO in return, and neither moves do anything to Necrozma-Dusk-Mane; Running coverage for potential Necrozma, in turn, leaves Mewtwo countered by Empoleon, and even if it ran moves for both, Calyrex-Ice would still wall it. The same problem applies, if Mewtwo runs Mineral Cannon, or Poltergeist/Night Daze, for Calyrex-Ice.
- Lastly, similarly to the Dark Memory: Mewtwo gains a weakness to Fighting Priority, which, in turn, opens the door for dangerous Pokemon with dubious Matchups against Base Mewtwo, such as Marshadow, and Gallade, to become confident Revenge-Killers.
- All of these factors result in Ice Memory Mewtwo having a greater dependence on the overall Team's collective strength, rather than its own indiviudal power, to bring out its full capabilities


Dubious Disc
Strengths
- Enables Mewtwo to viably run Flash sets, as Oversight converts it into a ???-Move, boosting its power, and enabling it to hit Ghosts.
- With the power of Flash, under Rain: Mewtwo is capable of one-shotting nearly every Dual-Typed Pokemon in the game
- Mewtwo's Flash is even powerful enough to take out certain Monotype Pokemon, however it is generally inconsistent
- Thanks to the Memory Mechanic's Power Bonus, and Mewtwo's Memory Ability, Oversight: Memory Blast hits harder than Stored Power
- When under any form of Weather, Mewtwo's ???-Moves become even stronger, allowing it to cleave through opponents
- Thanks to ???-Type moves having no resistances, or immunities: Mewtwo is able to brute force its way through its foes
- As Mewtwo has no Weaknesses, it becomes surprisingly difficult to revenge K.O.
- Notably, Mewtwo can potentially take a hit from any of Scarf Calyrex-Shadow's moves, provided Power Spot isn't active

Weaknesses
- ???-Type Mewtwo has no Weaknessess.... However, it also has no Resistances, nor does it hit anything Super-Effectively
- The only ???-Move that Mewtwo has, which hits Super-Effectively on anything, is Flash, which is what it usually runs
- This causes Dubious Disc Mewtwo, to arguably be the most gimmicky, and thus, inconsistent, Memory Set, of them all
- While the power boosts granted by Weather, and Oversight, are workable in conjuction with Mewtwo's massive offenses: It is almost always going to be a better investment, to either pick a Memory Disc with actual Type Matchups, or to Memorize an entirely different Pokemon, outright, and run an Adrenaline Orb


Ground Memory
Strengths
- Enables Mewtwo to nail Ho-Oh, without having to run Mineral Cannon, which effectively only hits Ho-Oh
- Thanks to the power of Memory Blast, and Ground-Type STAB, Mewtwo can obliterate Ho-Oh, Eternatus, Empoleon, Necrozma-Dusk-Mane, Zekrom, Dialga, and Entei, with a single move slot.
- Loses its weakness to priority Ghost-Type moves
- Grants it the ability to situationally beat certain Zekrom sets, after it has set up, including Electric Memory Zekrom

Weaknesses
- Gains neutrality to Fighting-Type Priority, making it still somewhat vulnerable to threats like Marshadow
- While it loses its Weaknesses to Ghost-Type Priority, it is replaced by three new weaknesses to Grass, and Ice, and most concerningly--Water -Type Priority, which makes Urshifu Rapid Strike, and Keldeo, into potential checks
- Ground Memory's aforementioned Memory Blast coverage, can be be approximated by an Adrenaline Orb set of Stored Power, Aura Sphere, Mineral Cannon, and a Dark-Type Move, as this set will hit, and OHKO all of the aforementioned Pokemon, with the exception of Empoleon, Necrozma-Dusk-Mane, and significantly invested Dialga sets. Meanwhile, another Pokemon could be given the Ground Memory, as they likely need it more.
- This problem becomes exacerbated by the high demand placed upon Mewtwo, to handle the other top attackers in the tier, such as Calyrex-Shadow; Mewtwo will want to run Dark Coverage to support its Team, however this creates significant overlap with Base Mewtwo's Adrenaline Orb sets
- Mewtwo must also be extra wary of opposing Calyrex-Ice, which can tank most of Mewtwo's attacks, and OHKO in return. This only reinforces the need to run an additional Dark-Type move, however, with a set of Stored Power, Memory Blast, and Night Daze, this only leaves one free slot left. Mewtwo gains one free move slot, in exchange for using the Team's only Memory Slot.


Water Memory
Strengths
- Aqua-Killer: With the combined power of Aqua Jet, and Aqua Rise, Mewtwo can increase its damage output to near unmanageable levels, enabling it to OHKO Cresselia with a 252 Atk Wave Crash, deal massive damage to its resists, and even OHKO opposing uninvested Calyrex-Shadow with Aqua Jet, after Stealth Rock Damage
- Significantly increases the power of Mewtwo's Water-Type moves, to the point where Hydro Pump can be used as a possible substitute for Stored Power, and can one-shot Ho-Oh, and Entei.
- Grants Mewtwo a spammable STAB, and improves its Matchup against certain threats, like Landorus-T
- Compliments Mewtwo's Stored Power, granting Mewtwo the ability to "dual-wield", and hit opponents with, effectively, two distinct Stored Powers, that each have entirely separate Type-Matchups
- Additionally, Mewtwo also receives a Power Bonus to its Ethereal Stream, which allows it to nail both Dialga, and Ho-Oh, without having to run Psycho Fire or Aura Sphere, and Mineral Cannon, respectively. It also hits Specially Defensive Assault Vest Lando-T hard, and OHKOs Entei, and every Zygarde Forme.
- Synergizes well with Rain Teams, on account of its Typing, and access to powerful Rain-Boosted Moves, such as its Water-Type Moves, Psychic Storm, and Flash.
- Fares notably better against standard Water-Type Checks, such as Suicune, Empoleon, Eternatus, and Calyrex-Ice, due to its massive selection of coverage moves, including Psychic Storm, Venoshock, Psycho Fire, Night Daze, and Mineral Cannon
- Loses its weakness to Ghost-Type Priority.

Weaknesses
- Swaps Fighting, and Ghost Priority weaknesses, for Grass, and Poison ones, the latter of which can be significantly boosted in power, via a Toxic Orb
- Is similar enough to Mewtwo, outside of its Aqua-Killer set, that it be suboptimal to run this Memory, without it. Using it, however, makes Mewtwo more predictable, and easier for opponents to deal with.
- Difficulty in finding a definitive niche, as the Meta generally already prepares for Water-Type moves, in consideration of Kyogre, who is arguably a significantly better Water-Type Pokemon
- Water Memory Mewtwo does not reliably check Kyogre, as it lacks the additional Special Defense boost, that its counterpart, Ice Memory, has, and additionally is weak to Electric-Type moves, allowing Sea Incense Kyogre to potentially beat it down
- Mewtwo gains a number of weaknesses, such as to Grass, Electric, Poison, and Lustrous Stream, while gaining nothing that it couldn't already do, in return.


Poison Memory
Strengths
- Due to its Memory Ability's effect, of raising both stats by 1 stage, upon switching in: Mewtwo is significantly bulkier.
- Imparts a number of useful resistances, including Electric, Fairy, and Fire
- Together, this makes Mewtwo into a decent Zekrom, Xerneas, and Entei contingency check
- As Mewtwo is no longer burdened by its middling Defenses, it can afford to run moves, such as Recover, and can even experiment with set-up, or Team Support moves
- Outside of Psycho Darts, which few Pokemon run: Mewtwo is completely freed of its Priority Weaknesses

Weaknesses
- Due to Poison being a somewhat irrelevant Offensive Type (save for a few exceptions): Mewtwo will often have nothing to use its newfound Poison-STAB on.
- This usually means that the best sets for Poison Memory Mewtwo, are similar to those of Adrenaline Orb Mewtwo, with the possible exception of Recover. While Poison Memory Mewtwo's bulk helps it justify the Memory Slot, bulkier Pokemon, with Memory Armor, would likely appreciate it more
- Poetically, for all of the useful resistances Mewtwo has gained: It is now weak to Psychic-Type moves, placing it at an even greater disadvantage against opposing Mewtwo, and Scarfed Calyrex-Shadow, neither of which care about Mewtwo's stat boosts, while forcing Mewtwo to either use a slot to run coverage for them, or eschew coverage, in favor of repeatedly switching out, once they enter the field, sacrificing your momentum.


Psychic Memory
Strengths
- Boosts the power of Mewtwo's Offensive Utility moves, such as Psychic Storm, and Psychic Wind, to the point where they are comparable in Base Power to an itemless Mewtwo's Stored Power
- The boost to Psychic Wind, in particular, allows Mewtwo to use it on a weakened opponent, to faint it, and potentially initiate a sweep 
- This improves Mewtwo's utility, somewhat, as it allows it to compress its coverage, without having to run moves that would ordinarily fall below the Meta's Power-Standard.
- Also boosts the power of Mewtwo's Priority Move, Psycho Darts, as well as its strongest Physical Psychic-Type Move, Psycho Blitz, on account of the STAB-stacking Bonus, that same-Type Memory Discs impart

Weaknesses
- While Psychic Wind sets can be devastating when executed properly, without these particular sets, the Disc uses much of its effectiveness
- This is the only Memory Disc with an actual penalty, particularly to Mewtwo's Burst Moves, meaning that, unlike with many other Pokemon, Mewtwo cannot simply use its same-Type Memory Disc as a direct upgrade for its vanilla sets.


						Mewtwo Microanalysis

Adrenaline Orb
Mechanics: Boosts the power of Mewtwo's moves
Usage Tips: Best for All-Out Attacking sets, as it is a strictly offensive Item; Likely Mewtwo's best offensive Item
Pros: Grants a Power Boost comparable to that of a Life Orb, without the Recoil
Cons: Doesn't provide Mewtwo with a means of raises its Speed, often forcing it to rely on Psychic Wind, to do so; Provides no direct Defensive Utility.

Energy Powder
Mechanics: Raises Pokemon's Speed by 1 stage upon successfully landing a Super-Effective Move
Usage Tips: Best used in the Mid to Late Game phase to ensure Mewtwo's Sweep goes unimpeded; Utility will ultimately prove more important than raw power, as Mewtwo will struggle to OHKO foes, such as Bulky Dialga, due to lacking its Adrenaline Orb. Thus, Psycho Fire may be a superior investment, over moves such as Stored Power, and Aura Sphere, as it condenses their roles. A Dark-Type move should also be run, to handle opposing Mewtwo, Meloetta, Cresselia, and Calyrexs. The other slots, however, are customizable.
Pros: Enables Mewtwo to potentially increase its Speed, without relying on weak Moves, such as Psychic Wind
Cons: Sacrifices the power of Adrenaline Orb, and only activates once. If Mewtwo fails to sweep, and is forced to switch out, it will be left Itemless

Berserk Gene
Mechanics: Mewtwo is perpetually burned, however its Atk is Raised by 2 stages upon switching in.
Usage Tips: Rain cures all burns, and prevents burns from happening; Mewtwo's Rain-Boosted Water-Moves are capable of dispatching most of the threats that would ordinarily require Dark-Type Moves, such as opposing Mewtwo, Calyrex-Shadow, and Meloetta.
Pros: Extremely high reward if used properly; Enables Mewtwo to use its more obscure Physical Moves, without having to Memorize
Cons: Requires significant Team Support and setup to execute properly; Without it, Mewtwo becomes effectively itemless

Sweet Apple
Mechanics: Heals Pokemon by a certain amount, upon switching out
Usage Tips: Allows Mewtwo to fearlessly brawl with Pokemon that otherwise might not always be OHKO'd by Mewtwo, but cannot OHKO it, in return, such as Cresselia, Ho-Oh, or Corviknight; Keeps Mewtwo healthy, which is relevant in certain Matchups, such as Timid Scarf Palkia, which threatens Mewtwo, but does not usually OHKO it, outright.
Pros: Significantly improves Mewtwo's longevity; Enables Mewtwo to play more aggressively, and wear down bad Matchups
Cons: Sacrifices the Power Boost of Adrenaline Orb, which in turn may force it into using redundant, or otherwise riskier moves to achieve the desired damage output.

Twisted Spoon
Mechanics: Raises Mewtwo's Spe by 1 stage, upon using a Status-Move; Resets all stats after 3 turns. Single Use.
Usage Tips: Hits through Protect, for 1/2 Damage; Best used with Nasty Plot; Good for crippling opposing Teams in the Mid to Late game stage; Keeps Twisted Spoon's Native x1.2 Psychic-Move boost
Pros: Enables Mewtwo to overcome Scarfers, whilst allowing it to use Nasty Plot, without sacrificing its momentum
Cons: Significantly narrower intrinsic Power Boost, compared to Adrenaline Orb; Immediately renders Mewtwo Itemless, upon successfully activating this Item's effects; Potentially vulnerable to being timed out

Odd Incense
Mechanics: Doubles the Base-Power of Psychic-Type moves, if the Pokemon is at or below 1/4 Max HP
Usage: Run Psystrike/Stored Power, Psycho Fire/Aura Sphere/Electro Ball/Dark Pulse, Psycho Darts, and Nasty Plot.
Pros: Easily the set with the highest overall Damage Output; Allows it to beat opposing priority with its own; Doesn't depend on coverage as a primary means to deal game-deciding Damage; Can potentially sweep Teams.

Cons: Requires extensive knowledge on the Metagame, so as to know what will proc, and what will just be unnecessary Damage, that potentially causes other moves that would have procced, to simply K.O. Mewtwo, instead; Most limited coverage out of all of Mewtwo's sets; Mewtwo needs Psycho Darts to justify this set's use over another, more consistent one, yet it also needs Psystrike, to improve its Matchup against Meloetta, Cresselia, and both Calyrexs, (Stored Power can potentially one shot the first three, but will fail to OHKO Calyrex-Ice). This leaves one final slot to handle the rest of Odd Incense Mewtwo's Bad MUs, such as Yveltal, Empoleon, a healthy Caly-Ice, and most concerning of all, Necrozma-Dusk-Mane, which tanks both Psystrike and Psycho Darts, and generally gives this set a hard time.


Eternatus Set
Eternatus @ Prism Scale  
Ability: spacepower  
EVs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe  
Modest Nature  
IVs: 0 Atk  
- Draco Meteor  
- Eternabeam  
- Magma Storm  
- Autotomize

Description: Draco Meteor, being a Heavy-Move (lowers a Pokemon's attacking stat by at least 2 stages), triggers Prism Scale, which raises the user's SpA by 3 stages upon using one of these moves, which allows Eternatus to set up with Autotomize (now raises Pokemon's speed by 4 stages) to outspeed the entire Tier, then proceed to unleash Draco Meteor on an opponent, to set up for a potential Eternabeam sweep. Magma Storm is a contingency move, to ensure that Eternatus can hit stray Steels that my be capable of resisting its other moves.




						Limited Meta Tier List

Description: The Tier List for the Pokemon Memories Meta before the introduction of Memorization. Once the mechanic was added to the game, the original Format, without the Memory Discs, became the "Limited"-line of Metagames that are currently on the ladder. As the Limited Meta is no longer the Standard Meta in the game; The pre-Memorize Tier List has been preserved for use in discerning the viability for Pokemon in this Format.

Note: The following placements represent the viability of the Pokemon, as assessed prior to the introduction of Memorization. As such, certain placements may be inaccurate, or outdated, including in the Limited Meta itself, as additional Balance Updates and Meta Developments may have affected the Meta. This list should not, therefore, be interpreted as the definitive Viability Rankings for Non-Memorized Pokemon; The Standard Tier List will offer a more accurate assessment of this.

							S-Tier

							Mewtwo
					              [ Psychic ]
			    (Hp: 170/Atk: 335/Def: 185/SpA: 338/SpD: 185/Spe: 187) BST: 1400
					     Pressure/Unnerve/Psychic Power


Description: Between its peerless offenses, blistering speed, and its perfectly distributed defenses; Mewtwo is an unparallaled force of mass destruction in this Meta. Whereas most Pokemon are biased toward specific sets, which serve as the primary cause for their exalted viability; Mewtwo is able to continuously adapt its sets on the fly, allowing it to always keep its opponents guessing. Its perfectly placed stats leave it with no major vulnerabilites, and its access to a nearly unlimited movepool, encompassing every Type in the game, makes it nigh uncounterable. Simply figuring out the opposing Mewtwo's set, is itself, a daunting undertaking, and actually managing to successfully faint it, is something that will usually only be possible after a very long struggle between both sides. Mewtwo's combination of attributes makes it a force to be reckoned with, and when paired with its dangerous unpredictability, powerful teammates, signature items, and phenomenal ability; This Genetic Masterpiece proves itself to be a powerful Pokemon that is second to none. We dreamed of creating the most powerful Pokemon, and we succeeded.


							Kyogre
						       [Water]
			    (Hp: 160/Atk: 240/Def: 180/SpA: 320/SpD: 280/Spe: 160) BST: 1340
					           Drizzle/Antipathy

Description: Thanks to its fantastic Special Attack stat, amazing Typing, access to the powerful Water Spout, and its amazing Ability, Drizzle; Kyogre is a menace to fight against, and is one of the most dangerous Pokemon in the game. With Choice Scarf, and a set of Water Spout/Origin Pulse/Thunder/Ice Beam, Kyogre is capable of shredding through almost anything that isn't a dedicated resist, through the power of its high BP moves, and impressive coverage. Kyogre can also run Choice Specs to punish players that were expecting a Scarfed set, and hit the Tier even harder. Wave Incense sacrifices the speed of Scarf, and the power of Specs, but grants Kyogre incredible power with its Water-Type moves, without locking it out of the rest of its set. Finally, and best of all, is its Sea Incense set; With a set of Origin Pulse/Thunder/Rain Dance/Thunder Wave, Kyogre can not only outspeed all but the more obscure Pokemon due to the Sea Incense boost, but can exploit its deadly combination of Rain and Paralysis to potentially cripple, or even check its own dedicated answers, allowing it to wreak havoc with its powerful attacking moves. Its amazing ability to threaten the entire tier, whilst potentially enabling certain teams through its Rain setting utility, not only makes Kyogre one of the best Pokemon in the game, but far and away, the most centralizing.


							Dialga
						    [Steel/Dragon]
			    (Hp: 230/Atk: 280/Def: 210/SpA: 280/SpD: 180/Spe: 160) BST: 1340
					     Pressure/Telepathy/Regenerator


Description: Dialga's massive defensive stats, stratospheric offenses, and excellent Type-Combination already make it a force to be reckoned with, however what truly sets it apart from the rest of its peers is access to the best Ability, and one of the best moves in the game--in Regenerator and Shell Smash respectively. Thanks to these two powerful resources, Dialga is capable of fulfilling a multitude of roles, from bulky tank, dedicated offense, hazard support, or even various hybrids of these sets--all while maintaining its Ability to perform excellently during games, and even potentially sweep the opponent. Dialga's ability to run nearly any kind of set--including frightening mixed sets, while synergizing with nearly every viable Item in the Tier--is unrivaled, and it is easily the most customizable Pokemon in the entire game. When building a Team, it is vital that players prepare an answer for this Master of Time, lest they find their ephemeral existence ground to dust.


						     Calyrex-Shadow
						     [Psychic/Ghost]
			    (Hp: 180/Atk: 250/Def: 180/SpA: 350/SpD: 260/Spe: 180) BST: 1400
					    Power Spot/Double-Layer/Antipathy


Description: In addition to having a dangerous Psychic/Ghost Type-Combination; Calyrex-Shadow also possesses an incredible Speed Stat, and one of the highest Special Attack stats in the entire game. Because of the incredible power it possesses, particularly through its devastating Astral Barrage, and Psycho Boost, Calyrex often doesn't even need to hold a damage-boosting Item to deal massive amounts of damage, and will often place immense pressure on opposing Teams through its sheer presence alone. Calyrex also has access to its signature Elemental Stones, which grant it a x1.2 boost on all of its attacks, grants Hyper Beam perfect accuracy, and changes Hyper Beam's Type to match the type of the compatible stone it is holding. This grants Calyrex a high degree of unpredictability, and further allows it to potentially defeat Pokemon that would otherwise give it trouble, such as Yveltal. While Astral Barage will no longer boost Calyrex's Special Attack, if it has at least +1 in its Special Attack, already, it is still an incredibly potent Snowballing tool, especially when paired with its new Ability, Power Spot, which grants Calyrex's moves a 50% power boost, if it has been reduced to 1/4 or less of its Max HP. Calyrex is one of the best Offensive Utility, and Late-Game Cleaner Pokemon in the game, and players would do well to prepare themselves for this menace.



						     Tier Assesments
S-Tier: Reserved for the absolute most powerful Pokemon; These Pokemon can fit on to every Team and immediately improve the group's viability through its presence alone, having the potential not only to fortify already powerful Teams, but elevate to viability Teams, Pokemon, and strategies that would otherwise be suboptimal without them. There are few, if any downsides to selecting a Pokemon from this Tier, and it is crucial that opponents have answers to these threats if their Team is to gain any traction in the Meta. 

A-Tier: Reserved for exemplary Pokemon that either fulfil a multitude of roles, or accomplish their specific roles with with peerless excellence. Pokemon in this Tier tend to have only minor weaknesses, all of which are almost completely compensated for by the immense utility provided for players' Teams. These are the Electrons that orbit the Nuclei of the Tier, and players will want to have at least one of these Pokemon on their Team if they hope to gain any traction in the Meta.

B-Tier: Reserved for Pokemon that serve noticeable functions in the Meta, with varying degrees of success. Many of the Pokemon in this Tier have profound, or even rare strengths which cannot be found in the A-Tier proper, but possess glaring weaknesses that prevent them from gaining a spot in the aforementioned Tier themselves. Strategic play and additional support may be required to bring out these Pokemons' full potential, however when played optimally, they may be able to give Players the particular utility they'll need to gain traction in the Meta.

C-Tier: Reserved for Pokemon that are capable of fulfilling certain roles with a certain degree of success, but lack either the consistency or environment to fully capitalize on their positive attributes. These Pokemon are typically outclassed by the Pokemon in the Tiers above them due to either lacking a sufficient number of relevant strengths, or possessing too many exploitable weaknessness, however many of these Pokemon may be capable of rising to one of the higher Tiers, should either the meta change, or new sets end up being discovered within their current Meta. These Pokemon may require considerable skill to play, but might just provide the necessary resources to help players gain traction in the Meta.

D-Tier: Reserved for Pokemon that are almost completely outclassed by the Pokemon in the Tiers above them due to a number of intrinsic factors, which may never be completely remedied even with new set discoveries or drastic Meta changes. Pokemon often merit this Tier, due to either insufficient stats, poor typing(s), insufficient movepools, or being completely outclassed in the few roles they do have, by other, significantly more powerful Pokemon, among which, may even be variants of themselves. Researching these Pokemon may be helpful, should an opponent endeavor to use one of these Pokemon in a game, however well-designed Teams will likely have resources that can handle one, or even many of these Pokemon, regardless. As such, these Pokemon are not helpful for gaining any traction in the Meta.

Unranked: Reserved for Pokemon that were experimented with during development, but failed to meet the Meta's standard to justify placement in a proper Tier; Since this game is primarily balanced around Ubers, it could be entirely possible for these Pokemon to be viable in lower Tiers, however in this Tier, these Pokemon fail to accomplish anything of value, and should realistically never be used if Players hope to gain any traction in the Meta.
