Dream Trio/Memory Trio Concept

Dream Type
Defensive
- The Dream Type's interactions with opposing Types
	- Weaknesses
		- Dark (Most vulnerable when asleep; Nightmares; etc.)
		- Fire (House Fires become inescapable if the target is asleep)
		- Sound (Dreams abhor Alarms)

	- Resistances
		- Grass (Representing the Laws of Nature: The Sleeping do not have to adhere to them)
		- Ground (Representing the Laws of Physics: They have no authority in the dream world)
		- Normal (Dreams are where people go to escape the outside world)
		- Psychic (People generally aren't concerned with thinking while they're asleep)

	- Immunities
		- Bug (Bugs tend to be wholly ignored or even swallowed by the Sleeping)

Offensive
- How the Dream Type interacts with opposing Types
	- Super-Effective 
		- Bug (Bugs usually do not exist in dreams)
		- Dark (Nefarious individuals cannot spread to the outside world when asleep)
		- Dragon (Since Dreams reify Dragons, that also means they can be slain)
		- Fairy (Since Dreams reify Fairies, they can therefore be destroyed here)

	- Semi-Effective
		- Normal (Reality is where dreams go to die)
		- Sound (Dreams become destabilized when exposed to external noise)
		- Steel (Appliances and Artificial Intelligence are generally incapable of dreaming)

	- Ineffective
		- Ghost (Since they are dead--or at least spiritual: They cannot dream)
