Speed Blitzer
Effect: Pokemon's Speed is boosted to x1.5 until they successfully use a Move.
Range: 255
==============================================================================================================
Special Mechanic: Memorization    
Description: Pokemon can choose a Memory Disc from each Type; These Discs impart the Pokemon with certain Type, and Ability.

Mechanics
Pokemon will gain the properties of its held Memory, upon Switching In; If the Pokemon shared a Type with the held Memory before it Memorized, it will gain a Perpetual-STAB, which increases the power of its STAB-Moves to x2. Any STAB that was not converted a Perpetual-STAB, becomes a Memory-STAB, which maintains the initial x1.5 Power Boost; Pokemon that do not share a Type with their held Memory, receive a 20% Base Power boost when using Moves that share the Type of the held Disc. All of the Pokemon's STABs that they had prior to this Mechanic activating, are preserved.

Memory-STAB
Any STABs that a Pokemon possessed prior to Memorizing, become Memory-STABs. Memory-STABs generally last until the Pokemon Switches Out, however if a Pokemon has a Forme-Changing Ability--such as Climate Change or Ensemble--which cause the Pokemon to change Type(s), their Memory-STAB will be updated to reflect the native Type(s) of the Forme they are changing into. If a Pokemon's Memory Disc matches one of their native Types, that Memory-STAB will become a Super-STAB. The allocation of Memory-STABs and Super-STABs are determined by the Type(s) that the Pokemon had while Switching In. Pokemon without a Super-STAB cannot obtain one by Forme-Changing into a Forme with Type(s) that match their Memory Disc, nor can Pokemon that only match their Disc due to Type-Changing Abilities.

Super-STAB
If a Pokemon's Type(s) match the Type of their held Memory Disc, their Memory-STAB will become a Super-STAB, which imparts a x2 Boost to STAB-Moves that match the Type of the held Memory Disc, as opposed to the standard x1.5 STAB Boost. Super-STABs will remain in effect, even if the Pokemon Forme-Changes into a Forme that no longer possesses the Pokemon's original Super-STAB Type (e.g. A Normal/Psychic Pokemon with a Psychic Memory that Forme-Changes into a Normal/Fighting Type, would possess a Normal-Type and Fighting-Type Memory-STAB, in addition to a Psychic-Type Super-STAB).

Special Mechanics
In addition to their own Ability, Pokemon will also gain the Ability of their respective Disc, granting them two Abilities. Memory Discs are unaffected by Item-Suppressing Mechanics.

Forme-Change Mechanics
Memorized Pokemon will maintain their Memory-Types, if they use a Move or Ability that modifies their Forme, however, their Memory-Type will be temporarily replaced, if a Pokemon uses a Move or Ability that directly modifies their Typing (e.g. Protean). Any Memorized Pokemon with a modified Type, will revert back to their Memory-Type, at the end of the turn; Arceus will change Types using the Memory Discs, however it will not change Formes.

Note: Due to in-game mechanics, the Memory-Type label will temporarily be hidden when a Pokemon changes Formes, however they will retain their Memory-Type, as stated.

Hazard Mechanics
Pokemon holding a Memory Disc will be treated as being the Type of the corresponding Disc, upon switching in, with one exception: Pokemon that naturally possessed an immunity to certain Hazards, are still regarded as having this immunity during their interactions with these Hazards, on the turn they switch in. The same does not apply for Stealth Rock, however; Pokemon will be regarded as having the Type of the Disc they are carrying, and will take damage corresponding to their new Type (e.g. A Steel-Type with a Water Memory will not be affected by Toxic Spikes, however, they will take neutral damage to Stealth Rock, rather than resisting it); If a Pokemon Memorizes into a Type that is weak to Stealth Rock, they will take Neutral Damage, rather than Super-Effective Damage.

Accuracy Mechanics
Any of the Pokemon's Moves that share a Type with their Memory Disc Type receive Perfect Accuracy (e.g. Water-Type Moves will have perfect accuracy if used by a Pokemon with a Water Memory).

Special Immunities
Memorized Pokemon will not receive Paralysis Damage

Restrictions
Only one Memory Disc is allowed in a Match, per game

Learnset
Hidden Power has been replaced in learnsets with Memory Blast; a 150BP, 100 Accuracy, ???-Type Move, that adopts the attacker's Memory Disc Type, and hits in the Category corresponding to their highest attacking stat.

Super-Memory Abilities

Special Mechanic: Ultra Assist     

New Item: Assist Drive
Description: A special Device that allows the holder to deplete their energy to unleash and share their latent abilities with the Team. After an Assist Drive is used, it will become an Assist Energy

Mechanics
Upon entering the field, the Pokemon instantly generates an Assist Field, which reduces the damage that their Team receives from attacks corresponding to the holder's Type(s) (e.g. If a Fire/Fighting Type uses the Assist Drive, opposing Fire-Type and Fighting-Type Moves will have reduced power). The Assist Drives also impart Assist Boosts depending on the holder's highest Raw Stat

Choice Scarf Penalty: Pokemon with an Attack or Special Attack Stat Assist will have x0.8 Attack, or Special Attack, respectively. This does not effect Pokemon with the "Beast" Abilities

Special Pokemon
Certain Pokemon have Special Assist States (known as EX Assist Fields) that have unique properties and impart certain benefits that cannot be obtained through normal Assist Fields.

Application
Once activated, the Assist Abilities will affect every Pokemon on the holder's Team

Item Interactions
Assist Drives are unaffected by Item-Suppressing Mechanics.

Type Assist
Type-Based Damage Reduction: 20%

Assist Boosts
Description: Pokemon will grant certain stat bonuses depending on certain factors. The Dominant Stat will receive the greatest boost, while the Recessive (Non-Highest) stat receive a 10% Boost
	- Standard Arbitration
		- Description: Ordinarily, Pokemon will be granted an Assist Boost depending on their Highest Stat.
	- IV-Dependent Arbitration
		- Description: Pokemon can "force" a certain Assist Boost by placing exactly 30 IVs into a given Stat
	- Abitration Priority
		- Description: In the event that a Pokemon has several equal Stats, or has 30 IVs in Multiple Stats, the Assist Boost that is chosen for them will be decided in the following order: (1): Hp, (2): Atk, (3): Def, (4): SpA, (5): SpD, (6): Spe

Assist Boosts
Hp: 50 Hp Restored at the end of each Turn
Atk: 30% Attack Boost / 10% SpA

Weather Terminology
Intrinsic Power (IP)
Description: The "Default" Base Power or Damage that a Move has before considering the effects of Weather or Field Conditions (e.g. Poke-A's "Fire Move" deals 90 Damage to Poke-B)

Extrinsic Power (EP)
Description: The Modifier to a Move's Base Power or Damage, as the result of external circumstances, such as Weather, or Field Conditions (e.g. "Fire Move" deals halved damage to Poke-B under Rain, reducing it to 45)

Net Power (NP)
Description: The result of the Intrinsic Power and the Extrinsic Power

Examples
Example A: Under ordinary circumstances, with no external conditions, the EP will be void, which will be represented here, as a multiplier of 1, for convenience. Therefore, Fire Move A would deal (90 * 1) Damage with no extrinsic modifiers

Example B: With the adverse effects of Rain, which halves the power of Fire-Type Moves, the calculation would change to (90 * 0.5), or 45.

Example C: If the Pokemon has an Intrinsic Property that doubles the Damage of the Move when under Rain, the calculation would change to ((90 * 2) * 0.5), for a result of (180 * 0.5), or 90.

Example D: If the Pokemon has an Extrinsic Property that doubles the Damage of the Move when under Rain, the calculation would become (90 * 2), for a result of 180

Example E: If the Pokemon has an Intrinsic Property that doubles the Damage of the Move under Rain, while also possessing an Ability or Item that neutralizes the Damage-Reducing Effects of the Weather, the calculation would change to ((90 *2) * 1), for a result of (180 * 1), or 180
