	- Ubers
		- Banlist Additions
			- Stakataka Clause: Stakataka cannot hold a Strange Ball
				- Explanation: Stakataka-Shadow was an attempt to forge a powerful Defensive Pokemon out of a predominately Offensive Mechanic, and it was successful... Far too successful. While it could not be determined whether Stakataka-Shadow was ultimately a stronger Pokemon that Mewtwo, it proved to be far more constricting to the Teambuilder than any of Mewtwo's Formes, or any Arceus Formes had ever been, during its brief run in Ubers. Ultimately, the Pokemon was not necessarily unbeatable, but severely degraded the quality of the Meta, necessitating a bulky Uproar-Pivot on every Team in order to not immediately get folded by it. Unfortunately, as is the case with many "broken" Pokemon, directly nerfing Stakataka-Shadow would likely create the opposite effect of endangering tis viability. Consequently, it is being held in Anything Goes for the time being
					Applies to: Limited Ubers, (Standard) Ubers

Resultingly, Necrozma-Ultra was effectively already a Base 187 HP Pokemon, since it is only legally usable through its Base Formes. Since this additional Health did not threaten the balance of the Tier, the decision was made to allow Necrozma-Ultra to keep these boosts

	- Legend Shadow
		- Penalty: Stored Power's Base Power is reduced by x0.67 if the Pokemon is holding a Strange Ball or Strange Essence
		- Explanation: Due to Shadow Mewtwo's astronomical stats, 20% Shadow State Boost, and Ability-Induced Damage Optimization, its Stored Power rivaled--an in certain cases, exceded the power of even Choice Scarf Kyogre's Water Spout under Rain. The discovery of this power could not result in anything short of a ban to AG if left unaddressed, so a compromise was made to nerf Shadow Mewtwo's Power in official formats, while leaving the door open for this Ability to remain unaffected in Formats where Shadow Submersion was not needed to access it

	- The following Moves have received modified Animations: Mineral Cannon
- Miscellaneous

	- Thunder Snare renamed to Thunder Spin


Mechanics
- Category-Based Damage Reducing Abilities
	- These Abilities will now reduce the power of moves from another Category that target the Defensive Category that these abilities reduce damage in (e.g. Compact Armor can now reduce the power of Psystrike and Darkest Nightfall)
- Special Coverage Moves
	- All Moves that have Special Type-Matchups (e.g. Freeze-Dry) will now bypass opposing Effectiveness-Modifying Defensive Options, including Abilities, Memory Abilities, and EX-Assists
		- Exceptions: Flying Press, and Special Coverage Moves that hit with halved effectiveness (such as moves that bypass immunities to deal resisted damage) are not subject to this change
- Statuses
	- Paralysis
		- Rain Damage: 1/4 -> 1/8
- Typechart
	- Ghost-Type
		- Defensive
			- Steel
				- Resisted -> Neutral
	- Rock-Type
		- Defensive
			- Burn Status: __ -> Immune

	- Memory Abilities
		- Exterminator
			- Resisted Hit Damage Multiplier: x1.5 -> x1.3

		- Super Memory Abilities
			- Super Fairy Aura
				- Corrected an oversight where Pokemon with this Ability were not immune to Passive Damage, as intended
				- Corrected an oversight where this Ability would heal its Team for longer than intended
- Ultra Assist
	- Miscellaneous
		- The Assist Drive no longer reveals which Assist Boost the Team is using (e.g. Atk, SpA; etc.)



Formats
- Ubers
	- Banlist Additions
		- Calyrex-Shadow Clause
			- Calyrex-Shadow cannot hold a Ghost Memory
				- Explanation: During the earliest stages of development, "Ghostrex" managed to remain "manageable" due to a combination of a faster paced Meta, and a greater prevalance of Tailwind blockers, which prevented it from snowballing games. A significant deal of time has passed from the days of said early Meta, however, and with the wane of "vanilla" Calyrex-Shadow (and with it, its various STAB Absorbers) and Utility Lockers, alongside the introduction of Overdrives--which had not yet existed back then, Calyrex-Shadow-Ghost has mutated into a Pokemon that has restrictive Defensive Counterplay, and no reliable Offensive answers, either, on account of the looming threat of a potentially game-deciding Speed Blitzer. Although it is not more powerful than the Mega Mewtwos, and might debatably even fall below Psychic Memory Mewtwo, it nonetheless manages to constrict the already overworked Teambuilder in a manner that makes it even more oppressive

- Clear Body-Related Abilities

Mechanics
- Memorization
	- Super Memorization
		- Super Fairy Aura
			- Additional Effect: Immune to Passive Damage
			- Passive Healing Restoration: 1/10 -> 1/8
				- Duration: 4 -> 8
					- Note: Despite intending for this effect to last for 10 Turns, it only lasted for 4 Turns due to an oversight. The current number of Turns has now been modified to reflect these corrections, and balancing adjustments


Formats

	- Ruleset (Note: These changes apply to both BH and Unlimited BH by default; Those marked by "*" only apply to BH)
		- Banlist Additions

			- Gene Therapy*
			- Parting Gift*
			- Utility Lock*
		- Clause Additions
			- Primal Groudon Clause*
				- Primal Groudon can only be accessed by a Groudon holding a Red Orb
					- Explanation: With solid defenses, a good typing, and a Base Attack Stat that reaches into the 400s, Primal Groudon's ability to exert tremendous pressure upon the Tier was virtually rivaled by none. Whether it was capitalizing off of its terrifying Desolate Land, running troublesome support sets, or, worse yet, utilizing its access to Memorization to become nigh-uncounterable: This Pokemon's offensive answers were oppressively limited, and its defensive answers, non-existent. The particular set that ultimately influenced this decision, however, was its Water Memory + Primordial Sea / Sacred Fire + Sacred Water set, which perfectly exploited the already concerning power of each of these particular moves, to create an uncounterable combination that warped the very foundation of the Tier.

- Mechanics

			- Spectral Force
				- Handicap: Pokemon's Ghost-Type Attacks are now resisted by opposing Normal-Type Pokemon

Formats
- Ubers
	- Ruleset
		- Banlist Additions
			- Mewtwo Clause
				- Mewtwo cannot hold a Dark Memory
					- Explanation: In a Meta where Teams already have to carefully select most of their Pokemon with "Standard" Mewtwo in mind, Mewtwo-Dark's access to a nigh-"inverted" Defensive Type, devastating STAB options that bypass its Base-Forme's Defensive Answers, powerful Priority to obliterate a number of threats including Base-Mewtwo itself, and one of the best Moves in the game in Uproar, turned Mewtwo-Dark into a nigh-uncounterable Pokemon that could obliterate the majority of the Base-Mewtwo-centered Tier, and force out what few obstacles remained to potentially fish for Matchups that could allow its Team to gain even more momentum. Mewtwo-Dark by itself would already be deserving of a ban-consideration, however its inverted Matchups compared to Standard Mewtwo not only makes them collectively unbeatable, but potentially leaves teams attempting to check both vulnerable to Mewtwo's Teammates, or even other Mewtwo Memory-Formes.

	- Ruleset
		- Banlist Additions
			- Mewtwo Clause
				- Mewtwo cannot hold a Dubious Disc
					- Explanation: While Dubious Disc Mewtwo was probably borderline at worst in its natural state: With the combination of Mystery Deluge, Psychic Fury, Nasty Plot, and Antipathy, it could fashion itself into a threat for which there was no answer. In some respects, Mewtwo-??? possessed qualities that even Arceus-??? and Deoxys-??? lacked, which is incompatible with the current direction of the Tier.

Abilities
- Impervious
	- Reintroduced
	- Effects: Imparts the Pokemon with an Immunity to a Type that corresponds to the Type of their held Super-Effective Damage-Reducing Berry
	- Changes: This Ability's effects can now be used by all Pokemon (applies for Formats such as Balanced Hackmons)
	- Explanation: This Ability was reintroduced in response to the possibility of Omnipotent being overwhelming within certain Formats. Having a weaker version of the Ability (which itself is simply an upgraded version of Impervious before its temporary suspension), allows Arceus to maintain the defensive utility imparted by Omnipotent, without the potentially oppressive power that accompanies it
- Omnipotent
	- No longer grants the Permaburst Effect
- Water Veil
	- Additional Effect: If a Dual-Type Pokemon has the Water-Type, its weaknesses from the non-Water Type are removed. Pokemon's Stats cannot be lowered by the opponent

Formats
- Ubers
	- Restrictions
		- Mewtwo Cluase
			- Mewtwo cannot hold a Fighting Memory
				- Explanation: Although none of Mewtwo's Physical options are particularly oppressive in its Base Forme, or its other Memory Forms: With a Fighting Memory, Mewtwo is able to turn Power-Up Punch and Receiving Strike into devastating nukes, while dealing lethal amounts of damage to threats that could otherwise oppose its Special Sets, due to the immense power it commands with its expansive list of Perfect Form "compatible" Physical Moves. Keeping Fighting Mewtwo, in the Meta's current state, would potentially cause the Meta to devolve into Fighting Mewtwo vs Psycho Darts Mewtwo 50/50s, which is not healthy for a Metagame.

Pokemon Memories v1.9.1
General

Abilities
- Bird of Prey

- Evergreen

- Grassy Blessing
	- Implemented

Statuses
- Evergreen Field
	- Effect: Pokemon heal 1/10 of their Max Hp at the end of each turn

Formats
- Ubers
	- Restrictions
		- Deoxys-Clause
			- Deoxys-Cannot hold a Fighting Memory
				- *While nowhere nearly as versatile or universally broken as Deoxys-Attack-???, in terms of raw damage output, Deoxys-Fighting was actually even more powerful thanks to its Memory Ability, Perfect Form, and access to Dynamic Punch. If played correctly, Deoxys could force itself in against threats that it carefully "vetted" through its Teammates, and unleash devastating attacks that, in some instances, could even OHKO through resistances. Despite not being as broken as its ???-Type Counterpart overall: Its massive advantage in brute force still made it uncounterable, and effectively uncheckable, defensively. Theoretically, Deoxys-Fighting could be argued to stimulate some manner of "complexity" in the Meta, since Scarfed--or Priority-Wielding Ghosts could give it trouble should they either predict an incoming Fighting-Type Move, or switch in from a fainted ally, however, sacrificing the rest of the Meta was not worth it to simulate Rock-Paper-Scissors in the Battle Simulator, and since Ubers is designed to be the "primary" Tier in this Game, where true Balance supercedes simply being theoretically beatable: This action was necessary
		- Mewtwo-Clause
			- Mewtwo cannot hold a Psychic Memory
				- *Although it wasn't fully apparent at first, in time it quickly appeared to be evident that Psychic Memory Mewtwo's uncounterable levels of power elevated it to levels that rivaled even its Mega Evolutions. In fact, Psychic Memory Mewtwo even has a niche over its Mega counterparts, in that it has more reliable bulk than Y, while being a better "mixed" attacker than either Mega ever was, due to its oppressive combination of Psystrike + Psycho Fire. So powerful was this Pokemon, that it could even be said that Psychic Memory Mewtwo was effectively "Mega Mewtwo Z", and with its only somewhat consistent nemesis, in Deoxys-A-???--being banished to join Arceus-???, and the other titans in AG: It was time for the AG Mega Mewtwo "Trifecta" to be completed.
			- Mewtwo cannot hold a Water Memory
				- *Although Water Sport Mewtwo, and Water Memory Mewtwo are not broken by themselves: When paired together, they formed a deadly combination that was not only uncounterable, but nigh-uncheckable. Considering that the Memory Disc had the "secondary" benefit of modifying Mewtwo's Typing, it even had a defensive niche over Psychic Memory Mewtwo, in that it could laugh at any former Super-Effective threats that had designed their sets around stopping "normal" Mewtwo and Mewtwo-Psychic, while still being comparably powerful. Short of using another Mewtwo, or hoping for a Speed Blitzer Super-Effective Move to hit, there are almost no true answers to this.

Pokemon Memories v1.8.1
Mechanics
- Overdrive
	- New Mechanic
	- Effect: Pokemon are able to draw forth an incredible power, depending on their Happiness Stat; Refer to the Custom Changelog Compilation for further details
	- Overdrive Display: Player's will have their Overdrives displayed at the beginning of each match; This display is only visible for each Player's own Team
- Speed and Turn Order
	- Speed and Turn Order are now calculated dynamically

Terminology, and Introduction to the Weather-Interactive Move Changes
- Intrinsic Power (IP): The "Default" Base Power or Damage that a Move has before considering the effects of Weather or Field Conditions (e.g. Poke-A's "Fire Move" deals 90 Damage to Poke-B)
- Extrinsic Power (EP): The Modifier to a Move's Base Power or Damage, as the result of external circumstances, such as Weather, or Field Conditions (e.g. "Fire Move" deals halved damage to Poke-B under Rain, reducing it to 45)
- Net Power (NP): The result of the Intrinsic Power and the Extrinsic Power
	- Example A: Under ordinary circumstances, with no external conditions, the EP will be void, which will be represented here as a multiplier of 1, for convenience. Therefore, Fire Move A would deal (90 * 1) Damage with no extrinsic modifiers
	- Example B: With the adverse effects of Rain, which halves the power of Fire-Type Moves, the calculation would change to (90 * 0.5), or 45.
	- Example C: If the Pokemon has an Intrinsic Property that doubles the Damage of the Move when under Rain, the calculation would change to ((90 * 2) * 0.5), for a result of (180 * 0.5), or 90.
		- However, if a Pokemon had an Ability or Item that allowed it to bypass the mitigating effects of Weather, while still possessing this Intrinsic Multiplier, the move's Net Power (NP) would become doubled, rather than merely counteracting the Weather. For this reason, the changes to the Weather-Interacting Moves were necessary

Weather
- Now supports special Extrinsic Power reduction, and Universal Weather "EP" boosts and reductions, respectively

Abilities
- Poison Heal
	- Memory-Interactive Poison Activation: Upon Switching-In -> Upon Switching-In, and during any moment that the Pokemon is not Poisoned or Intoxicated

Items
- Shiny Stone
	- Now subject to Attrition: Subsequent uses will only prevent V-Create from dropping the user's stats, but will not impart any boosts

Pokemon Memories v1.1.7 (12/1/22)
- Memorized Pokemon will now maintain their Memory-Type if they Transform; Their Memory-Type will still be temporarily displaced by Abilities like Protean, however, in order to maintain their functionality.




Pokemon Memories v1.1.6 (12/1/22)
Mechanics
- Fixed Memorize Mechanic to change Pokemon back to its Memory Type at the end of a turn, if it changed Types through a move or transformation.
- Fixed issue where Dual-Typed Pokemon's Compensatory-STAB would stack with their true-STAB, upon using a Forme Change to retrieve one of their lost Types
- Streamlined internal coding to remove a number of redundancies
