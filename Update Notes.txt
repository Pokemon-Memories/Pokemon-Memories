Pokemon Memories v1.9.4
General
- Animations
	- The following Moves have received Animations: "Aqua Step", "Blazing Blast", "Compact Stream", "Crowd Control", "Crystal Rush", "Earth Power", "Electro Strike", "Flutter Song", "Flutter Step", "Frost Step", "Frosty Glide", "Iron Run", "Magma Storm", "Malice Run", "Paddle Kick", "Pixie Run", "Prattle Rattle", "Receiving Strike", "Sludge Rush", "Smash Hit", "Snow Rush", "Spectral Ball", "Sweet Retreat", "Thermal Press", "Vital Dance"

Formats
- Ubers
	- Restrictions
		- Mewtwo Cluase
			- Mewtwo cannot hold a Fighting Memory
				- Explanation: Although none of Mewtwo's Physical options are particularly oppressive in its Base Forme, or its other Memory Forms: With a Fighting Memory, Mewtwo is able to turn Power-Up Punch and Receiving Strike into devastating nukes, while dealing lethal amounts of damage to threats that could otherwise oppose its Special Sets, due to the immense power it commands with its expansive list of Perfect Form "compatible" Physical Moves. Keeping Fighting Mewtwo, in the Meta's current state, would potentially cause the Meta to devolve into Fighting Mewtwo vs Psycho Darts Mewtwo 50/50s, which is not healthy for a Metagame.

Mechanics
- Memorization
	- Super Memory Abilities
		- Implemented
		- Description: When a Pokemon shares an Ability with their Memory Ability, the two will combine to form a "Super Memory Ability". These Special Abilities will either amplify the effects of the Base Ability, or introduce new Properties to the Ability, altogether

				- Effect: x1.5 Base Power on all Moves; Additional x1.2 Damage if the Move is Super-Effective. Pokemon's Secondary Effects are still removed.

Pokemon Memories v1.9.1
General
- Animations
	- The following Moves received Modified Animations: "Vanishing Strike"
Abilities
- Bird of Prey

Statuses

	- Effect: Pokemon heal 1/10 of their Max Hp at the end of each turn

Formats
- Ubers
	- Restrictions
		- Deoxys-Clause
			- Deoxys-Cannot hold a Fighting Memory
				- *While nowhere nearly as versatile or universally broken as Deoxys-Attack-???, in terms of raw damage output, Deoxys-Fighting was actually even more powerful thanks to its Memory Ability, Perfect Form, and access to Dynamic Punch. If played correctly, Deoxys could force itself in against threats that it carefully "vetted" through its Teammates, and unleash devastating attacks that, in some instances, could even OHKO through resistances. Despite not being as broken as its ???-Type Counterpart overall: Its massive advantage in brute force still made it uncounterable, and effectively uncheckable, defensively. Theoretically, Deoxys-Fighting could be argued to stimulate some manner of "complexity" in the Meta, since Scarfed--or Priority-Wielding Ghosts could give it trouble should they either predict an incoming Fighting-Type Move, or switch in from a fainted ally, however, sacrificing the rest of the Meta was not worth it to simulate Rock-Paper-Scissors in the Battle Simulator, and since Ubers is designed to be the "primary" Tier in this Game, where true Balance supercedes simply being theoretically beatable: This action was necessary
		- Mewtwo-Clause
			- Mewtwo cannot hold a Psychic Memory
				- *Although it wasn't fully apparent at first, in time it quickly appeared to be evident that Psychic Memory Mewtwo's uncounterable levels of power elevated it to levels that rivaled even its Mega Evolutions. In fact, Psychic Memory Mewtwo even has a niche over its Mega counterparts, in that it has more reliable bulk than Y, while being a better "mixed" attacker than either Mega ever was, due to its oppressive combination of Psystrike + Psycho Fire. So powerful was this Pokemon, that it could even be said that Psychic Memory Mewtwo was effectively "Mega Mewtwo Z", and with its only somewhat consistent nemesis, in Deoxys-A-???--being banished to join Arceus-???, and the other titans in AG: It was time for the AG Mega Mewtwo "Trifecta" to be completed.
			- Mewtwo cannot hold a Water Memory
				- *Although Water Sport Mewtwo, and Water Memory Mewtwo are not broken by themselves: When paired together, they formed a deadly combination that was not only uncounterable, but nigh-uncheckable. Considering that the Memory Disc had the "secondary" benefit of modifying Mewtwo's Typing, it even had a defensive niche over Psychic Memory Mewtwo, in that it could laugh at any former Super-Effective threats that had designed their sets around stopping "normal" Mewtwo and Mewtwo-Psychic, while still being comparably powerful. Short of using another Mewtwo, or hoping for a Speed Blitzer Super-Effective Move to hit, there are almost no true answers to this.

Pokemon Memories v1.8.1
Mechanics
- Overdrive
	- New Mechanic
	- Effect: Pokemon are able to draw forth an incredible power, depending on their Happiness Stat; Refer to the Custom Changelog Compilation for further details
	- Overdrive Display: Player's will have their Overdrives displayed at the beginning of each match; This display is only visible for each Player's own Team
- Speed and Turn Order
	- Speed and Turn Order are now calculated dynamically

Terminology, and Introduction to the Weather-Interactive Move Changes
- Intrinsic Power (IP): The "Default" Base Power or Damage that a Move has before considering the effects of Weather or Field Conditions (e.g. Poke-A's "Fire Move" deals 90 Damage to Poke-B)
- Extrinsic Power (EP): The Modifier to a Move's Base Power or Damage, as the result of external circumstances, such as Weather, or Field Conditions (e.g. "Fire Move" deals halved damage to Poke-B under Rain, reducing it to 45)
- Net Power (NP): The result of the Intrinsic Power and the Extrinsic Power
	- Example A: Under ordinary circumstances, with no external conditions, the EP will be void, which will be represented here as a multiplier of 1, for convenience. Therefore, Fire Move A would deal (90 * 1) Damage with no extrinsic modifiers
	- Example B: With the adverse effects of Rain, which halves the power of Fire-Type Moves, the calculation would change to (90 * 0.5), or 45.
	- Example C: If the Pokemon has an Intrinsic Property that doubles the Damage of the Move when under Rain, the calculation would change to ((90 * 2) * 0.5), for a result of (180 * 0.5), or 90.
		- However, if a Pokemon had an Ability or Item that allowed it to bypass the mitigating effects of Weather, while still possessing this Intrinsic Multiplier, the move's Net Power (NP) would become doubled, rather than merely counteracting the Weather. For this reason, the changes to the Weather-Interacting Moves were necessary

Weather
- Now supports special Extrinsic Power reduction, and Universal Weather "EP" boosts and reductions, respectively

Abilities
- Poison Heal
	- Memory-Interactive Poison Activation: Upon Switching-In -> Upon Switching-In, and during any moment that the Pokemon is not Poisoned or Intoxicated
